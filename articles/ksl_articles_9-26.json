No injuries were reported.\"The arrestee committed a violent felony in a road rage incident against a stranger that was driving during their daily commute. The impulsive and violent actions of the suspect clearly demonstrate Kenneth is a substantial danger to any individual and the community,\" police wrote in their affidavit.Unified Police Sgt. Aymee Race says prior to the shooting, the victim told police that he noticed Richardson driving aggressively behind him. As Richardson continued to follow the victim, at one point he allegedly drove into the bike lane and tried cutting off the victim by swerving into him before firing a round, Race said. The victim continued driving after the shot and was pulled over a short time later by a Unified officer while trying to get away. When the victim told the officer what had happened, the road rage investigation began.Officers returned to the area where the shot was allegedly fired and found a shell casing, the affidavit states.Detectives learned that Richardson goes to a smoke shop in the area on almost a daily basis and was seen there prior to the shooting, the affidavit states. They were able to collect enough information to identify Richardson as a possible suspect and found the vehicle allegedly involved in the road rage parked at his home in Holladay, according to the affidavit.On Wednesday, Richardson was stopped by Salt Lake City police and found to have marijuana in his vehicle in addition to \"an empty firearm case for a 9 mm handgun, and a partially filled box of 9 mm ammunition,\" the affidavit states.A red hoodie that matched what the alleged gunman wore in the Sept. 21 shooting was also found, police stated. What prompted Richardson to allegedly go after the other driver remained under investigation Thursday.According to court records, Richardson was convicted of aggravated assault in 2018. In that case, Richardson had been working at Dunford Bakery for three days but became upset and aggressive when being told how to perform his duties, according to charging documents. After he was asked to leave, Richardson threatened to shoot one employee and slashed another with a knife, the charges state."}, {"source": "ksl.com", "url": "https://www.ksl.com/article/51140323/the-us-is-mailing-americans-covid-tests-again-heres-how-to-get-them", "title": "The US is mailing Americans COVID tests again.

The tests will begin shipping, via the United States Postal Service, as soon as next week.The website has been reopened on the heels of a summer COVID-19 virus wave and heading into the fall and winter respiratory virus season, with health officials urging Americans to get an updated COVID-19 booster and their yearly flu shot.\"Before you visit with your family and friends this holiday season, take a quick test and help keep them safe from COVID-19,\" U.S. Health and Human Services Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response Dawn O'Connell said in a statement.U.S. regulators approved an updated COVID-19 vaccine that is designed to combat the recent virus strains and, they hope, forthcoming winter ones, too. Vaccine uptake is waning, however. Most Americans have some immunity from prior infections or vaccinations, but under a quarter of U.S. adults took last fall's COVID-19 shot.Using the swab, people can detect current virus strains ahead of the fall and winter respiratory virus season and the holidays. Over-the-counter COVID-19 at-home tests typically cost around $11, as of last year. Insurers are no longer required to cover the cost of the tests.Before using any existing at-home COVID-19 tests, you should check the expiration date. Many of the tests have been given an extended expiration from the date listed on the box. You can check on the Food and Drug Administration's website to see if that's the case for any of your remaining tests at home.Since COVID-19 first began its spread in 2020, U.S. taxpayers have poured billions of dollars into developing and purchasing COVID-19 tests as well as vaccines.

District Court Judge Mark Stevens, who gave him a 45-day suspended jail sentence and a year of unsupervised probation, called the matter \"a case of epic tragedy.\"Thompson's attorney said in court there were no warning signs that Austin Thompson \u2014 accused of five counts of murder as well as other charges \u2014 would commit violence.

He then shot multiple neighbors, including an off-duty Raleigh police officer on his way to work, according to police.Dressed in camouflage with multiple weapons strapped to his belt, he was located by law enforcement in a shed near a public greenway and arrested after an hours-long standoff. Investigators have said a handgun and a shotgun were used in the shootings.Wake County Assistant District Attorney Luke Bumm said Wednesday a handgun found in the shed belonged to Alan Thompson. According to Bumm, Alan Thompson kept the loaded 9 mm handgun in an unlocked box on a bedside table. The gun was consistent with evidence around the earliest victims, Bumm said. Alan Thompson was initially charged last year.Babb said Austin Thompson showed no signs of violence and that his father spoke with him twice on the phone in the moments leading up to and after the mass shooting.\"He did not seem agitated,\" Babb said. \"He did not seem angry. He did not seem upset.\"Babb said Alan Thompson spoke to him while driving home from work, and that he asked if he needed anything while he stopped to get a gallon of milk. He then saw police cars rushing toward the Hedingham neighborhood and called again to tell Austin Thompson to \"hunker down,\" according to Babb.Police work a shooting scene on Osprey Cove Drive in the Hedingham neighborhood in Raleigh, N.C., Oct. 13, 2022. (Photo: Ethan Hyman, The News & Observer)Police initially wouldn't let Alan Thompson enter the house, Babb said, and first responders told him his older son was killed and his younger son was missing. Babb said he assumed his younger son had gone to pursue the killer but that's when an officer told him \"Austin was not chasing the shooter. Austin was the shooter.\"\"Alan never in a million years thought his own family member would behave this way, he is heartbroken,\" Babb said.Also killed in the shootings were Officer Gabriel Torres, Mary Elizabeth Marshall, Nicole Connors and Susan Karnatz. Two other people were wounded during the shootings, including another officer. Austin is also accused of attempted murder, assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill and assault with a firearm on a law enforcement officer.Investigators seized 11 firearms and 160 boxes of ammunition \u2014 some of them empty \u2014 from the Thompson home, according to search warrants.

And it's a painful day. But inside all of that is a day when we will finally reveal why, for 10 months, I've gone through this. And I look forward to defending myself,\" he said.As Adams and others close to him addressed the media, protesters heckled them, with some chanting \"abuse of power\" as police circled them and one shouting, \"He's a corrupt mayor. He deserves to be in handcuffs.\"Federal prosecutors allege in the indictment that Adams \"not only accepted but sought illegal campaign contributions\" to his mayoral campaign. A senior official in the Turkish diplomatic establishment \"facilitated many straw donations\" to Adams and arranged for Adams and his companions to receive free or discounted travel on Turkey's national airline to destinations including France, China, Sri Lanka, India, Hungary, and Turkey, the indictment alleges.Adams \"compounded his gains\" from the illegal campaign contributions by gaming the city's matching funds program, which provides a generous match for small dollar donations. His campaign received more than $10 million in matching public funds as a result of the false certifications, according to the indictment.Adams allegedly \"solicited and demanded\" bribes, including free and heavily discounted luxury travel benefits from a Turkish official, the indictment alleges, noting that the official was seeking Adams' help pertaining to regulations of the Turkish consulate in Manhattan. Adams created and instructed others to create fake paper trails in order to falsely suggest he had paid for travel benefits that were actually free, prosecutors allege. He also deleted messages with others involved in his misconduct, at one point assuring a co-conspirator that he \"always\" deleted her text messages, according to the indictment.The charges were made public hours after FBI agents entered the mayor's official residence and seized his phone early Thursday.Adams spent 22 years in New York City's police department before going into politics, first as a state senator and then as Brooklyn borough president. He was elected as the city's second Black mayor in 2021.Gov. Kathy Hochul has the power to remove Adams from office. Her spokesperson, Avi Small, issued a statement late Wednesday that said \"Governor Hochul is aware of these concerning news reports and is monitoring the situation. It would be premature to comment further until the matter is confirmed by law enforcement.\"The indictment caps an extraordinary few weeks in New York City, as federal investigators have honed in on members of Adams' inner circle, producing a drumbeat of raids, subpoenas and high-level resignations that have thrust City Hall into crisis.Federal prosecutors are believed to be leading multiple, separate inquiries involving Adams and his senior aides, relatives of those aides, campaign fundraising and possible influence peddling of the police and fire departments.In the last two weeks alone, the city's police commissioner and head of the school's system have announced their resignations.FBI agents had seized Adams' electronic devices nearly a year ago as part of an investigation focused, at least partly, on campaign contributions and Adams' interactions with the Turkish government. Because the charges were sealed, it was unknown whether they dealt with those same matters.In early September, federal investigators seized devices from his police commissioner, schools chancellor, two deputy mayors and other trusted confidants both in and out of City Hall.All have denied wrongdoing.Correction: This story was updated to correct that prosecutors say Adams' campaign received more than $10 million, not more than $10,000, in matching public funds as a result of the false certifications."}, {"source": "ksl.com", "url": "https://www.ksl.com/article/51139714/dj-vu-state-committee-orders-utah-ag-to-release-his-calendar-again", "title": "D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu: State committee orders Utah AG to release his calendar again", "author": "Annie Knox and Daniella Rivera, KSL-TV", "date": "Sept. 26, 2024 at 10:02 a.m.", "content": "SALT LAKE CITY \u2013 A state panel has decided again that Attorney General Sean Reyes's calendar is part of the public record and ordered Reyes' office to turn it over to the KSL Investigators.The State Records Committee voted 5-1 in KSL-TV's favor Wednesday, finding a new state law shielding government officials' calendars from public view doesn't apply to a KSL record request submitted shortly before the law took effect.\"Our lawmakers made a choice not to apply the new law to pending open records requests,\" Tammy Frisby, an attorney representing KSL in the records case, said after the hearing. \"Rather than respecting that choice, Attorney General Reyes continues to spend public resources to try to conceal information about how he spends his time.\"The decision fits in line with the committee's prior two orders on Reyes' calendar: the first in favor of the television station and a later order siding with the Salt Lake Tribune. Reyes' office has sued both news organizations to appeal the committee's decisions.An attorney general's spokesperson did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Reyes came under scrutiny in recent years for his time away from the office, including travel overseas with the nonprofit Operation Underground Railroad, a World Cup junket, and a visit to Nevada following the 2020 election.The attorney general has said he took those trips on his own time, without using taxpayer money. Hoping to learn more about how Reyes spends his hours on the clock, KSL filed a public records request in 2022.The State Records Committee first sided with KSL in the calendar battle the following year. Reyes sued KSL and the records committee to appeal, but a judge ruled the public and press get to see the record. Reyes' office is now appealing that court ruling.The public records showdown also spilled over to the state Capitol in February. Hours after the judge ruled in favor of KSL, lawmakers approved a proposal concealing calendars. The governor signed it into law the next day.Just after the February court ruling in KSL's favor, but before the new law passed, the news organization filed a new request for Reyes' calendar over a longer period of time \u2013 about four years \u2013 dating back to January 2020. Previously, KSL had asked to see two-and-a-half months' worth of the schedule, from August to mid-November of 2022.The records committee considered the newer, bigger request Wednesday. Committee members decided the new law does not apply retroactively, saying the new law made a substantive change rather than a procedural one.The panel voted in a meeting videoconference after deliberating in a closed session Wednesday. It heard arguments in the case on Sept. 19.Attorneys for KSL argued the public has a right to see officials' calendars in order to figure out how they're spending their time and how they're doing their jobs. The news organization agreed to redactions for Reyes' personal appointments and for locations of his work meetings.The attorney general's office argued lawmakers made clear in passing the measure that they believed calendars had always been intended stay under wraps.Records committee member Ed Biehler, who cast the only \"no\" vote Wednesday, noted the lawmaker behind the move described it to colleagues at the Legislature as a clarification rather than a true change.With those comments in mind, Biehler said, \"I believe that it is procedural and not substantive.\"In December, as public scrutiny of his ties to Operation Underground Railroad mounted, Reyes announced he would not seek reelection. His term ends in January."}, {"source": "ksl.com", "url": "https://www.ksl.com/article/51140158/hoda-kotb-is-leaving-nbcs-today", "title": "Hoda Kotb is leaving NBC's 'Today'", "author": "Jordan Valinsky and Brian Stelter, CNN", "date": "Sept. 26, 2024 at 9:35 a.m.", "content": "NEW YORK \u2014 Hoda Kotb, the co-host of NBC's morning show, \"Today,\" is leaving her position early next year, she announced Thursday.Kotb, one of the most famous faces on NBC, has co-hosted the program with Savannah Guthrie since 2017, taking over from Matt Lauer, who was fired following allegations of inappropriate sexual behavior at work.\"It was time for me to turn the page at 60,\" Kotb said on \"Today\" Thursday while holding back tears. \"I decided this is the right time for me to move on. I obviously had my kiddos late in life and I was thinking that they deserve a bigger piece of my time pie that I have.\"Kotb is viewed inside NBC as a crucial part of the \"Today\" show's connective tissue, since she hosts both the top two hours of as well as the 10 am \"Hoda & Jenna\" talk show.She added that it was the \"hardest decision of her life.\" Kotb has two young daughters that she adopted and wants to spend more time with them.Kotb joined NBC in 1998 as a correspondent on the \"Dateline\" newsmagazine. She was later named the co-host of the 10 am hour of \"Today\" in 2008 with Kathie Lee Gifford until 2019, when Jenna Bush Hager took over the role.Guthrie said that \"we don't want to imagine this place without you, so it's complicated because we love you so much and we don't ever want you to go away.\" However, she told her that she has \"guts for someone to leave at the top of their game.\"Kotb's exit represents one of the biggest changes to the morning television landscape in at least a decade. Shows like \"Today\" and ABC's \"Good Morning America\" are highly profitable parts of their parent companies and are cultural icons, even as the broadcast business shrinks overall.Network executives strive for consistency and when transitions have to happen, they manage the comings and goings very carefully, since so many ratings points are at stake.In a letter to \"Today\" staffers, Kotb said \"happily and gratefully, I plan to remain a part of the NBC family, the longest work relationship I've been lucky enough to hold close to my heart. I'll be around. How could I not? Family is family and you all will always be a part of mine.\"NBC did not immediately name a successor for Kotb, and it likely will not do so for months."}, {"source": "ksl.com", "url": "https://www.ksl.com/article/51139834/as-utah-womens-basketball-prepares-for-big-12-transition-high-expectations-remain", "title": "As Utah women's basketball prepares for Big 12 transition, high expectations remain", "author": "                                            Josh Furlong, KSL.com", "date": "Sept. 26, 2024 at 9:02 a.m.", "content": "SALT LAKE CITY \u2014 Lynne Roberts welcomed the high expectations at the end of last season.The Utah women's basketball coach told the world that her team's standard should no longer be measured on whether they make an appearance in the NCAA Tournament, but rather how deep into March her team can play.Making it to the Big Dance is just the beginning.For the third consecutive season, Utah made it to the NCAA Tournament last season. But the team fell short of its preseason goal to make it to the Elite Eight after several injuries finally caught up with the Utes against a sharpshooting Gonzaga team on their home court.But as Roberts and her team prepare for the upcoming season \u2014 their first in the Big 12 \u2014 none of those expectations have changed.\"Different year, same expectations,\" Roberts said on the first official day of practice on Monday. \"We're in a good place with where our program's at. Every year we bring in really good freshmen, and we've got a couple transfers, too, this year. But they're joining a group of established veterans, and so our culture's intact.\"They know what the expectations are. But, yeah, our expectations haven't changed. We want to make the NCAA Tournament, make a run in it, have a chance to compete for Big 12 title. Those expectations aren't going to change.\"The conference affiliation may have changed, as well as some of the personnel \u2014 Utah lost Alissa Pili, Issy Palmer and Dasia Young to graduation, though Young is now on the coaching staff \u2014 but everything else remains intact.It's a veteran unit that knows what it takes to meet, and potentially exceed, expectations for another season.The biggest boost to the team's potential success is the return of \"difference maker\" Gianna Kneepkens, who suffered a season-ending injury early in the 2023-24 season.\"Adding Gianna Kneepkens back is a blessing, and we're excited about that,\" Roberts said.\"G is a difference maker in every sense of the word,\" she added. \"She just brings a level of swagger when she plays. She's still not feeling like she's back to her normal self, and it probably will take a couple months to where she's completely ready for games. She hasn't been back that long, but she just brings a level of swagger that you can't put a value on it, or you can't really describe it.\"Kneepkens is cleared to play and will continue to acclimate back to the game as the season progresses. And as she feels more comfortable with her game, she'll resume her role as one of the best shot creators on the team.\"It's so good. Just really excited to be back out on the floor,\" Kneepkens said. \"Just feels like great energy out there. I mean, I'm just grateful to be out there. We've had great staff, coaching, teammates through the process, so just excited for this year. It went by fast, even though the days felt really slow.\"Utah Utes head coach Lynne Roberts talks to her team from the bench during the first half of an NCAA women's basketball game at the Jon M. Huntsman Center on the University of Utah campus in Salt Lake City on Saturday, Nov. 16, 2019. (Photo: Colter Peterson, Deseret News)But Kneepkens is just one part of a veteran team that returns starting guards Ines Vieira and Kennady McQueen, starting forward Jenna Johnson, and designated sixth-man Maty Wilke, who really developed as the season progressed last season as she was thrust into a starting role.Wilke is one of the players that Roberts said she's looking forward to seeing on the court the most this season, simply due to all the hard work she's put in over the offseason to continue to develop and improve her game.\"I'm most excited for her, I think, coming into this season,\" Roberts said. \"She's put in so much work in the dark when no one's watching, and she's playing with a different level of confidence and comfortability. I think she's gonna be someone that people aren't gonna talk about now, but at the end of the season, they're gonna be talking about. ... She looks really good.\"Beyond the familiar faces \u2014 which also includes forwards Reese Ross and Sam Crispe \u2014 Utah brought in Rhode Island transfer Maye Toure, who Roberts sees big things from and someone that will play a lot as Utah attempts to replace Pili in some fashion in the post.\"She's super athletic \u2014 6-3, 6-4,\" Roberts said. \"She's gonna do well \u2014 plays really, really hard.\"There's also Michigan transfer Chyra Evans and freshmen Brooke Walker, Kylie Ray and Grace Foster who will help round out some depth pieces for a team that will continue to put an emphasis on hitting at a high rate from behind the 3-point line, while also utilizing some of the inside-out game with its post play to keep the shots flowing from deep.Day 1\ufe0f\u20e3#GoUtespic.twitter.com/5t6ktuo79H\u2014 Utah Women's Basketball (@UTAHWBB) September 23, 2024The identity of the team, Roberts said, won't change \u2014 even as the personnel does. There will be new nuances and wrinkles to the game, but the identity and culture of the program will remain intact.\"I think it is my job to read who you have, use the summer and even the fall workouts to figure out what you have, what you don't have, and then kind of create a system that maybe plays to strengths,\" she said. \"But our identity of working really, really hard, we're going to help \u2014 the goal is always to play harder than you, play with toughness, and a collective spirit.\"Build on who we are, what we have, but we're adding some things and doing things a little differently because of personnel. ... So I think we're able to do some more things defensively and offensively; we've got to adapt a little bit.\"The biggest change will likely come from the outside as Utah transitions from a loaded and highly-competitive Pac-12 that featured several ranked teams on a yearly basis with the Big 12.But that change has the opportunity to be a good thing, too, according to Johnson.\"We're used to really hard competition, so I think that'd be good,\" Johnson said. \"I think the style of play, it's a little bit different in the Big 12. But I think also, like, they have to guard us. I think that gives us confidence. Like, we play a difficult style of basketball. We've played against people that have seen us year after year, so now it's kind of fun going in. Obviously a challenge on our end, but also a big challenge on their end to defend a team that they never really have.Kneepkens said playing \"some of the best competition in the country\" in the Pac-12 has prepared the team to manage the transition, especially as an experienced team.\"I think that will be good because we played great competition, and moving to the Big 12, it's another 16 deep of great teams,\" Kneepkens said. \"So just knowing that each night's not going to be easy, from top to bottom, so I think that's the most important thing. And just staying consistent each day, starting practice today, and building off it every single day, so we can be great by the time it's March, but just focusing on today now.\""}, {"source": "ksl.com", "url": "https://www.ksl.com/article/51139610/mortgage-lenders-see-uptick-in-refinance-new-purchase-activity-with-lower-rates", "title": "Mortgage lenders see uptick in refinance, new purchase activity with lower rates", "author": "Daniel Woodruff, KSL-TV", "date": "Sept. 26, 2024 at 8:43 a.m.", "content": "SALT LAKE CITY \u2014 Lenders in Utah and across the country are seeing an uptick in people looking for mortgages.The Mortgage Bankers Association reported Wednesday that mortgage applications were up 11% week over week, driven by falling mortgage rates.

This year, the day will be spent competing on the \"American Ninja Warrior\" stage in Las Vegas in memory of her son who drowned 13 years ago at the age of 3.\"My son's name was Victory Morgan, and he drowned in a swimming pool,\" Paige recalled. \"He was riding his tricycle and the bike went in. When it happened, we were thrown into every parent's worst nightmare where you call 911, and you watch the paramedics work on your son, and you just keep wondering when you're going to wake up.\"The accident happened in 2011, and Victory spent the next seven weeks in the hospital before losing his battle. It was a couple of days after he died when Paige found a way to cope with the grief: She went running.\"I was a casual runner until my son passed away, and then once he passed away, running took on a different life for me because it became a means for me to process stuff,\" she said. \"My son passed away on a Saturday, and then I went to church on Sunday, and then Monday morning I got up and I went for a run. The weight of grief is so real and so heavy, and I just needed all these different ways to help carry it. Running went from something that was just kind of moderately enjoyable for me to being something that was therapeutic.\"Paige began running longer distances including the half marathon, and as she regained a fitness level that she hadn't experienced before, she felt her body and mind wanting more. She joined a local gym to gain some upper body strength and then was introduced by a family member to bouldering. The act of conquering obstacles awakened something in her that would propel her into a world she didn't know existed.\"I had never bouldered before, and I fell in love with the idea that you have this problem that you have to solve, and you get stronger as you face your problems,\" she said.Getting stronger in the face of adversity became a way of life for Paige, and she wanted to exemplify it not just for herself, but she had a burning desire to help others who may also be struggling. One day about six years ago, she said that she had a thought pop into her mind that she couldn't explain.'Maybe God was trying to tell me something'\"I was at the gym, and I had this thought in my mind saying, 'You should apply for 'American Ninja Warrior,'\" Paige recalled. \"It was so strange because literally my only qualification for applying for 'American Ninja Warrior' was that I had watched 'American Ninja Warrior.' And so that thought was just absolutely insane to me. I just kind of pushed it aside, but then it was so weird because I'd go back to the bouldering gym early in the morning, and the thought just kept coming back.\"This was not my idea because I did not want to do it,\" she continued. \"I grew up a very religious person, and I just thought that maybe God was trying to tell me something. So I literally said a prayer that I never thought I would ever offer. And that prayer was, 'God. I have a feeling that I should apply to 'American Ninja Warrior.' Is this something you really want me to do?'She said the answer was \"yes.\"\"I had spent enough time developing a personal relationship with God that when he told me to do something, I knew I should listen. I thought that maybe there would be a casting producer who would read my story, and it would mean something to them and maybe that's why God is asking me to do it,\" Paige said.It turned out that someone did take notice, and in April of 2019, 34-year-old Paige got the call to be on the show in Tacoma, Washington. She described being intimidated as she waited for her turn to compete as \"just a mom\" surrounded by elite and even professional athletes. She said it was then when she felt a nudge from her son, Victory.\"As I went to the starting line, all of a sudden, I felt my son who passed away, and it was totally unexpected,\" she said. \"I didn't expect to feel him there, but all of a sudden I just felt a voice say, 'Let's do this, Mom.' I feel like all of my hesitancy and the fear kind of left at that moment.\"Paige was able to make it all the way to the fourth obstacle, which she learned was quite the accomplishment, not just for a rookie. Unfortunately, due to the editing process, her run wasn't aired on the show. And with it not being aired and her story not being shared, she started to wonder why God was asking her to compete.For the next three years, she continued her goal of being on the show, and each consecutive year, she would apply and get the call to compete. And each year when it came time for the show to air, she would be notified that her run would not be shown on television. And then a difficult run last year, with a fall early on, devastated her.A shift of perspectiveAs each year went on, and as Paige continued to improve upon her physical strength, she started to notice that her mental and spiritual strength was growing as well. Also an accomplished artist, she grew her professional studio and honed her craft.In May of this year, one of her art pieces was featured in a video on YouTube by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The piece was an image of hands catching a falling sparrow as a \"tribute to God's love for her and her family.\"She said that as she has strengthened herself, she has grown closer to God and has been better able to understand what she describes as God's purpose for her.\"I was actually devastated last year,\" she said. \"I remember going to my hotel room and just sobbing because I just felt so robbed. And then I felt God be like, 'Oh, wait, did you think this was about a TV show, Jen? Yeah, look at you. You're a totally different person. You are so much stronger. I care way more about the development of an individual than I do about a TV show.'\"With a shift in perspective, Paige decided to apply for the show one more time. This time, it was for her. Little did she know that when she got the call this past summer saying that she had made the cut, that she would be met with another message from God.She would be competing on Thursday, Sept. 26, which would be the 13th anniversary of the day her son, Victory, fell in the pool.\"When they called me and told me that my run day was Sept. 26, I knew it was a message from God,\" she said. \"There are a lot of other days in the year, and to have it on that day feels really beautiful and poetic, because I draw a lot of inspiration from my son, Victory.\"While the verdict on whether or not Paige makes it to the buzzer on \"American Ninja Warrior\" will take several more months, Paige said that Victory will always be hers."}]
