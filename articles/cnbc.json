U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres handed down the decision, which was\u00a0hailed as a landmark win for the crypto industry. Still, while XRP isn't considered a security when sold to retail investors on exchanges, it is considered an unregistered security offering if sold to institutional investors.Ripple declined to comment but referred to Wednesday evening posts on X by CEO Brad Garlinghouse and chief legal officer Stuart Alderoty.Alderoty said the company is evaluating whether to file a cross appeal, and called the SEC's decision to appeal \"disappointing, but not surprising.\" The SEC, under Chair Gary Gensler, has become notorious for its refusal to provide clear guidance for crypto businesses, instead opting to regulate by enforcement actions.\"XRP's status as a non-security is the law of the land today - and that does not change even in the face of this misguided - and infuriating - appeal,\" Garlinghouse said on X.Earlier on Wednesday, Bitwise Asset Management, an issuer of ETFs tracking bitcoin (BITB) and ether (ETHW), submitted a registration filing for what would be the first XRP ETF \u2013 two days after registering an XRP trust product in Delaware. Grayscale, which also has bitcoin (GBTC) and ether (ETHE) ETFs, introduced a similar trust product in September.XRP, which was created by the founders of Ripple, is the native token of the open source XRP Ledger, which Ripple uses in its cross-border payments business.\u00a0It is the fifth-largest coin by market cap, excluding stablecoins\u00a0Tether (USDT)\u00a0and USD Coin (USDC).Elsewhere in the crypto market, bitcoin rose 1% to $60,941.60, while ether fell more 1% to $2,350.24.

Shares of Nvidia were up about 3% on Thursday morning.Blackwell, expected to cost between $30,000 and $40,000 per unit, is in hot demand from companies like OpenAI, Microsoft, Meta and other firms building AI data centers to power products like ChatGPT and Copilot.Nvidia has been the main beneficiary of the artificial intelligence boom, with shares up about 150% year-to-date. The company's revenue continued to surge during the fiscal second quarter to $30.04 billion, up 122% on an annual basis. It expects $32.5 billion in sales during the current quarter.\"At a time when the technology is moving so fast, it gives us an opportunity to triple down, to really drive the innovation cycle so that we can increase capabilities, increase our throughput, decrease our costs, decrease our energy consumption,\" Huang told CNBC. \"We're on a path to do that, and everything's on track.\"Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress said in August that the company expects to ship several billion dollars in Blackwell revenue in the company's fourth fiscal quarter.

It follows news Wednesday that OpenAI closed its recent funding round at a valuation of $157 billion, including the $6.6 billion the company raised from an extensive roster of investment firms and big tech companies.JPMorgan Chase, Citi, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Santander, Wells Fargo, SMBC, UBS, and HSBC all participated.The base credit line is $4 billion, with an option to increase it by an additional $2 billion. The loan is unsecured and can be tapped over the course of three years. OpenAI's interest rate is equal to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate plus 100 basis points. SOFR, a measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight, sat at just over 5% as of early this week, meaning OpenAI would be paying roughly 6% on money that it borrows right away.\"This means we now have access to over $10 billion in liquidity, which gives us the flexibility to invest in new initiatives and operate with full agility as we scale,\" OpenAI wrote in a Thursday blog post, adding that the company plans to use the money to invest in research and products, expand infrastructure, and attract talent. \"It also reaffirms our partnership with an exceptional group of financial institutions, many of whom are also OpenAI customers.\" OpenAI's latest funding round included an extensive roster of investment firms and big tech companies. Led by Thrive Capital, which planned to invest $1 billion, investors included existing backer\u00a0Microsoft\u00a0as well as chipmaker\u00a0Nvidia. SoftBank, Khosla Ventures, Altimeter Capital, Fidelity Management & Research Co., MGX and Tiger Global also participated, according to sources familiar with the situation.OpenAI's rapid ascent, which began with the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022, has been the biggest story in the tech industry over the last couple of years, bringing the concept of generative artificial intelligence into the mainstream and paving the way for tens of billions of dollars of investments in AI infrastructure. Earlier this year, OpenAI was valued at a reported $80 billion, up from $29 billion in 2023.OpenAI generated $300 million in revenue last month, up 1,700% since the beginning of last year, CNBC\u00a0confirmed\u00a0last week, following reporting by The New York Times. The company expects to bring in $11.6 billion in sales next year, up from $3.7 billion in 2024, according to a person close to OpenAI who asked not to be named because the financials are confidential.But all that revenue is extremely costly, as OpenAI has to ramp up purchases of Nvidia's graphics processing units to train and run its large language models. The company expects to lose about $5 billion this year, the person said. Microsoft has invested billions of dollars in OpenAI and is a key partner as the software giant bolsters its Azure cloud business.In an on-air appearance Thursday, OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar said of the restructuring rumors, \"We have discussed this, that we are looking into how we restructure from here.\"Later, Friar added, \"We just want to be kind of a more traditional company. Why make things complicated that don't need to be complicated? We need to make sure we can continue to get investments so that we are a sustainable, long-term participant in this ecosystem, and we want to make sure it's a company that works for all of our stakeholders.\"OpenAI has also experienced plenty of growing pains in recent months, including the loss of key executives, a trend that continued\u00a0through last week with the departures of CTO Mira Murati, research chief Bob McGrew and Barret Zoph, research vice president.OpenAI held an all-hands meeting last Thursday following the board's decision to consider restructuring the company to a\u00a0for-profit business, according to a person with knowledge of the matter, who said that should the change occur, the nonprofit segment would remain as a separate entity.At that meeting, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman\u00a0denied reports of plans\u00a0for him to receive a \"giant equity stake\" in the company, calling that information \"just not true,\" according to the person, who was in attendance.OpenAI Chairman Bret Taylor told CNBC in a statement last week that while the board has talked about the matter, no specific figures are on the table.\"The board has had discussions about whether it would be beneficial to the company and our mission to have Sam be compensated with equity, but no specific figures have been discussed nor have any decisions been made,\" Taylor said.When asked about whether the company will eventually go public, Friar told CNBC Thursday in the same on-air appearance that the company has \"really big aspirations of, 'How do we keep investing and what drives this technology?' It's compute first, and it's not cheap. It's great talent second, and then, of course, it's all the normal operating expenses of a more traditional company.\"Friar added, \"To that end, we do want to get make sure we're being creative in where we can go to tap capital. To your point, sometimes that's public markets, sometimes that's debt markets, sometimes it's project finance, structured finance.

A commitment to data sharing, albeit needed, simply isn't good enough,\" Malouf added.A Meta spokesperson told CNBC that its intelligence-sharing framework for banks \"is designed to enable banks to share information so we can work together to protect people using our respective services.\"\"Fraud is a multi-sector spanning issue that can only be addressed by working collaboratively,\" the spokesperson said via email. \"We encourage banks including Revolut to join in this effort.\"New payment industry reforms will come into force in the U.K. on Oct. 7 that require banks and payment firms to issue victims of so-called authorized push payment (APP) fraud a maximum compensation of \u00a385,000 ($111,000).Britain's Payments System Regulator had previously recommended a \u00a3415,000 maximum compensation amount for fraud victims, but backed down following backlash from banks and payment firms.Revolut's Malouf said that, while his company is on board with steps the U.K. government is taking to combat fraud, Meta and other social media platforms should do their part to financially compensate those who fall victim to fraud as a result of scams originating on their sites.The fintech firm published a report Thursday alleging that 62% of user-reported fraud on its online banking platform originated from Meta, down from 64% last year.Facebook was the most common source of all scams reported by Revolut users, accounting for 39% of fraud, while WhatsApp was the second-highest source of such events with an 18% share, the bank said in its \"Consumer Security and Financial Crime Report.\" " }, { "page": "https://www.cnbc.com/technology/?page=1", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/03/klarna-ceo-european-tech-brain-drain-number-one-risk-ahead-of-ipo.html", "date": "Thu, Oct 3rd 2024", "author": "Ryan Browne", "title": "Klarna CEO says European tech brain drain is \u2018number one risk\u2019 ahead of IPO", "content": "A European technology talent brain drain is the biggest risk factor facing Klarna as the Swedish payments company gets closer to its upcoming initial public offering, according to CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski.In a wide-ranging interview with CNBC this week, Siemiatkowski said that unfavorable rules in Europe on employee stock options \u2014\u00a0a common form of equity compensation tech firms offer to their staff \u2014\u00a0could lead to Klarna losing talent to technology giants in the U.S. such as Google, Apple and Meta.As Klarna \u2014\u00a0which is known for its popular buy now, pay later installment plans \u2014\u00a0prepares for its IPO, the lack of attractiveness of Europe as a place for the best and brightest to work has become a much more prominent fear, Siemiatkowski told CNBC.\"When we looked at the risks of the IPO, which is a number one risk in my opinion? Our compensation,\" said Siemiatkowski, who is approaching his 20th year as CEO of the financial technology firm. He was referring to company risk factors, which are a common element of IPO prospectus filings.Compared to a basket of its publicly-listed peers, Klarna offers only a fifth of its equity as a share of its revenue, according to a study obtained by CNBC which the company paid consulting firm Compensia to produce. However, the study also showed that Klarna's publicly-listed peers offer six times the amount of equity that it does. Siemiatkowski said there a number of hurdles blocking Klarna and its European tech peers from offering employees in the region more favorable employee stock option plans, including costs that erode the value of shares they are granted when they join. In the U.K. and Sweden, he explained that employee social security payments deducted from their stock rewards are \"uncapped,\" meaning that staff at companies in these countries stand to lose more than people at firms in, say, Germany and Italy where there are concrete caps in place.The higher a firm's stock price, the more it must pay toward employees' social benefits, making it difficult for companies to plan expenses effectively. Britain and Sweden also calculate social benefits on the actual value of employees' equity upon sale in liquidity events like an IPO.\"It's not that companies are not willing to pay that,\" Siemiatkowski said. \"The biggest issue is the lack of predictability. If a staff cost is entirely associated with my stock price, and that has implications on my PNL [profit and loss] ... it has cost implications for the company. It makes it impossible to plan.\"In the past year, Siemiatkowski has more clearly signalled Klarna's ambitions to go public soon. In an interview with CNBC's \"Closing Bell,\" he said that a 2024 listing was \"not impossible.\" In August, Bloomberg reported Klarna was close to selecting Goldman Sachs as the lead underwriter for its IPO in 2025.Siemiatkowski declined to comment on where the company will go public and said nothing has been confirmed yet on timing. Still, when it does go public, Klarna will be among the first major fintech names to successfully debut on a stock exchange in several years. Affirm, one of Klarna's closest competitors in the U.S., went public in 2021. Afterpay, another Klarna competitor, was acquired by Jack Dorsey's payments company Block in 2021 for $29 billion. A study by venture capital firm Index Ventures last year found that, on average, employees at late-stage European startups own around 10% of the companies they work for, compared to 20% in the U.S.Out of a selection of 24 countries, the U.K. ranks highly overall. However, it does a poorer job when it comes to the administration burdens associated with treatment of these plans. Sweden, meanwhile, fares worse, performing badly on factors such as the scope of the plans and strike price, the Index study said.Asked whether he's worried Klarna employees\u00a0may look to leave the company for an American tech firm instead, Siemiakowski said it's a \"risk,\" particularly as the firm is expanding aggressively in the U.S.\"The more prominent we become in the U.S market, the more people see us and recognize us \u2014\u00a0and the more their LinkedIn inbox is going to be pinged by offers from others,\" Siemiatkowski told CNBC.He added that, in Europe, there's \"unfortunately a sentiment that you shouldn't pay that much to really talented people,\" especially when it comes to people working in the financial services industry.\"There is more of that sentiment than in the U.S., and that is unfortunately hurting competitiveness,\" Klarna's co-founder said. \"If you get approached by Google, they will fix your visa. They will transfer you to the U.S. These issues that used to be there, they're not there anymore.\"\"The most talented pool is very mobile today,\" he added, noting that its now easier for staff to work remotely from a region that's outside a company's physical office space.

According to LSEG, analysts on average were expecting deliveries of 469,828 vehicles. An independent researcher widely followed by Tesla fans who publishes as \"Troy Teslike\" predicted the EV maker would report deliveries of 472,000 in the quarter.Tesla also sends its own company-compiled consensus to select investors and influencers. In its most recent survey of 30 analysts' estimates, Tesla had said analysts were expecting 461,978 deliveries, which would suggest a beat. Deliveries are not defined in Tesla's financial disclosures, but are the closest approximation to units sold reported by the company.

The stock is now up almost 4% in 2024, trailing the Nasdaq, which has gained 19%.Tesla's brand has been under pressure in the U.S. due in part to the antics of CEO Elon Musk, who, in addition to endorsing former President Donald Trump, has shared what the White House called \"racist hate,\" and false claims about immigrants and election fraud on X, his social media app.But Tesla still sells more battery electric vehicles in the U.S. than any other automaker, with Hyundai a distant second.In its third-quarter earnings report later this month, investors will be particularly focused on profit margins.Tesla has continued to offer attractive financing options and an array of incentives to drive sales volume in recent months in China as well as in the U.S. Prior to earnings, Tesla will host a marketing event on Oct. 10, and is expected to show off the design of a \"dedicated robotaxi.\"Musk has promised Tesla self-driving cars for years, but the company has yet to deliver.

We have learned the lessons of this investigation and are confident that these changes and the strength of our franchise put us in a strong position to continue executing our strategy of safe, sustainable growth, supported by a robust risk management and control framework,\" he added. Starling, one of the U.K.'s most popular online-only challenger banks, has been widely viewed as a potential IPO candidate in the coming year or so. The startup previously signaled plans to go public, but has moved back its expected timing from an earlier targeted an IPO as early as 2023.The FCA said in a statement that, as Starling expanded from 43,000 customers in 2017 to 3.6 million in 2023, the bank's measures to tackle financial crimes failed to keep pace with that growth.The FCA began looking into financial crime controls at digital challenger banks in 2021, concerned that fintech brands' anti-money laundering and know-your-customer compliance systems weren't robust enough to prevent fraud, money laundering and sanctions evasion on their platforms.After this probe was first opened, Starling agreed to stop opening new bank accounts for high-risk customers until it improved its internal controls. However, the FCA says that Starling failed to comply with this provision and opened over 54,000 accounts for 49,000 high-risk customers between September 2021 and November 2023.In January 2023, Starling became aware that, since 2017, its automated system was only screening clients against a fraction of the full list of individuals and entities subject to financial sanctions, the FCA said, adding that the bank identified systemic issues in its sanctions framework in an internal review.Since then, Starling has reported multiple potential breaches of financial sanctions to relevant authorities, according to the British regulator.The FCA said that Starling has already established programs to remediate the breaches it identified and to enhance its wider financial crime control framework.The British regulator added that its investigation into Starling completed in 14 months from opening, compared to an average of 42 months for cases closed in the calendar year 2023/24.

The firm also prohibits ads that promise unrealistic results or guarantee a financial return.

More recently, Tesla reported deliveries of 443,956 and production of 410,831 vehicles for the second quarter of 2024.If Tesla meets analysts' expectations that would represent a 6.5% year-over-year increase for deliveries after declines in the first and second quarters of 2024.Deliveries are not defined in Tesla's financial disclosures, but they are the closest approximation to units sold reported by the company.In the third quarter, as it did earlier this year, Tesla continued to offer a variety of incentives and financing plans to drive sales volumes, particularly in the largest market for EVs in the world, mainland China.Tesla hasn't given specific guidance for the full year of deliveries in 2024, but the company has said it expects a lower delivery growth rate this year versus last. Wells Fargo, pointing to this lack of guidance, said in a note that it's expecting 1.63 million full-year deliveries for Tesla and third-quarter deliveries at around 440,000, below consensus.Goldman Sachs last week said it expects Tesla deliveries and production \"to come in-line with consensus, largely driven by the strength in the China market.\" Goldman Sachs recommended buying call options ahead of the Wednesday report.Robotaxi day in focusShares in the EV maker are up more than 20% over the past month, in anticipation that deliveries could improve year over year and sequentially in the third quarter, and ahead of the company's robotaxi day on Oct. 10.Tesla plans to host investors and fans at its \"We, Robot\" marketing event at a Warner Bros.

It also accuses the company of retaliation after it allegedly sidelined Napoli and took him off big projects when he raised concerns that the person had been rehired.\"I had spoken to my employer about this \u2026 on numerous occasions and I was told that he would not be able to enter our offices, that he would not be hired again, and then like, all of a sudden, this guy is reaching out to me [on Meta's internal messaging system],\" Napoli, a marketing leader who works out of Meta's New York City office, told CNBC in an interview. \"I trusted that my employer would be able to keep me safe, right? Because stalkers and harassers are also workplace hazards\u2026 And this isn't just a hazard for me, this is a dangerous individual that was let back into the workplace.\"\u00a0The lawsuit comes after CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced in March 2023 that Meta would be\u00a0reducing\u00a0the size of its recruiting team as part of a larger strategy to cut 21,000 jobs, remove layers of middle management and operate more efficiently.Meta owns Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp. Although Wall Street has responded\u00a0favorably\u00a0to Meta's cost-cutting plans, layoffs in the company's customer service and trust and safety teams have made it harder for the social networking giant to respond to concerns from\u00a0small businesses and influencers, as well as\u00a0state and local election officials\u00a0who use Facebook and Instagram, CNBC has previously\u00a0reported.In the aftermath of Meta's cost-cutting efforts and ensuing layoffs, attorneys for Napoli say in the lawsuit that the company is relying \"more heavily on hiring employees through outside contractors\" and employs \"far fewer recruiters to screen applicants,\" which has negatively impacted their ability to properly catch red flags.\"Meta's employment practices are apparently so chaotic, reckless, and ineffectual that the company fails to keep track of the most fundamental data point in its workplace \u2013 the dangerous people who pose a severe risk to Meta's own employees,\" the lawsuit, filed by attorneys Carrie Goldberg and Peter Romer-Friedman, states. \"Yet Meta tells the public and public officials that the company has the ability to safeguard the personal data of billions of children and adults on their platforms.\"Meta has previously dealt with similar allegations that it's employed workers who have engaged in stalking and related activity. For example, in 2018, the company said it\u00a0fired a security engineer\u00a0who allegedly used internal data to stalk women online.Meta didn't immediately respond to request for comment on the lawsuit filed Tuesday. The person accused of stalking Napoli, identified only by the initials \"G.F.\" in the complaint, was a member of Meta's marketing team before he was laid off in November 2022 when the company cut 13% of its staff as part of a larger restructuring.\u00a0Before the layoffs, G.F. and Napoli occasionally saw each other in meetings but were no more than \"work acquaintances,\" Napoli said. After G.F. lost his job, he reached out to Napoli for support and asked him to get a coffee. During that meeting, the accused stalker started making \"disturbing\" comments, the filing states.\u00a0\"[He] told me that he hears voices, God talks to him, and God had been talking to him about me since April of that year, and he sent me a list of documents that were his like journal entries over the months,\" Napoli recalled.Napoli \"immediately\" reported the incident to his manager and to HR, and says at first he was concerned for G.F.'s well-being. But over the next year, Napoli says, the situation escalated.\u00a0G.F. began sending Napoli up to 30 messages a day, contacting his family members and referencing Napoli's partner, friends and even his dog, Luigi, in messages.\u00a0\"I am being mind tortured with an A.I tech which I don't know where it's coming from and I am feeling like my love for you is being used for experiences I didn't agree for, while I am being told by spirits that you and I are the two messengers,\" G.F. wrote in one message to Napoli, according to the complaint.\u00a0G.F. found out where Napoli lived and \"personally delivered a large ream of disturbing writings and drawings\" to the apartment, forcing Napoli and his partner to move, the lawsuit says.\u00a0\"It really felt like I was drowning for a long time because there was just nothing that I could do to escape. \u2026 It was really terrifying,\" said Napoli. \"I was worried about going out, I was worried about my dog, I was worried about my partner, because they were all mentioned by this person.\"\u00a0Napoli reported G.F. to the police and considered getting a restraining order, but under New York state law orders of protection are only available to people who have an intimate or familial relationship to their stalker, the lawsuit states.\u00a0In September 2023, Napoli informed Meta that the stalking had increased \"in both frequency and severity,\" and the HR department assured him that G.F. was on the company's \"Do Not Hire\" list and its \"No Entry\" list, which identifies people who shouldn't be permitted into company buildings.But just four months later, the company hired G.F. back to a contractor position after he apparently slipped through the cracks in the hiring process, the lawsuit says. Napoli learned his accused stalker was back at Meta when G.F.'s name popped up on Workplace, the company's internal messaging system. Napoli says he received a message from G.F. stating that he'd been rehired and would be seeing him at meetings and events.\u00a0\"To have all of that come back after I was guaranteed that I would be kept safe, it was really harrowing,\" said Napoli. \"I immediately went to [HR]... they let me know that they were equally stunned. They didn't have an answer as to how it happened, and they let me know that they would investigate.\"\u00a0 For the next month, Napoli says he \"lived in terror of interacting with G.F. at work\" until Meta notified him that G.F. had been terminated. However, after G.F. lost his job a second time, his \"stalking and harassment of Mr. Napoli significantly amplified and became more creative, sexually violent, and obsessive,\" the lawsuit states.As Napoli grappled with the continued stalking, he also faced what the lawsuit says was retaliation at Meta for complaining to his managers and to HR about the decision to rehire G.F.Napoli had been tapped to lead an artificial intelligence marketing push at Meta, but says that in response to his complaints, those projects were taken away and he found himself sidelined with reduced responsibilities.\u00a0In his complaint, Napoli is asking for damages but didn't specify an amount. He also asked the court to enter judgements that would prohibit G.F. from being rehired at Meta and prohibit the company from \"engaging in any further discriminatory or retaliatory acts\" against Napoli.\u00a0\"I want to be able to do my job, and I want to be able to do my job without feeling like the shoe is going to drop,\" said Napoli. \"I am very passionate about my work, and I take a lot of pride in my work, and that is really all I want to be able to do.\"\u00a0Napoli said he decided to tell his story because he wants Meta to make reforms that would prevent something like this from happening again.\u00a0\"It doesn't seem to me as though there are the right processes in place to stop this from happening to ... me or to someone else,\" said Napoli. \"Everybody deserves a safe workplace.\"\u00a0 " }, { "page": "https://www.cnbc.com/technology/?page=1", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/01/microsoft-starts-rolling-out-windows-11-2024-update-version-24h2.html", "date": "Tue, Oct 1st 2024", "author": "Jordan Novet", "title": "Microsoft starts rolling out Windows 11 update with energy use, Wi-Fi features", "content": "Microsoft said Thursday that it's starting the process of releasing a broad update to its Windows 11 operating system for PCs.Today, Windows accounts for just 9% of Microsoft's $245 billion in fiscal 2024 revenue, acquisitions of public companies Activision Blizzard and Nuance Communications. But revenue from Windows is highly profitable, and the widespread use of Windows on computers has helped Microsoft attract clients to its Azure cloud. So the product enhancements keep coming, before support for the popular Windows 10 ends in October 2025.Following its introduction in 2021, Windows 11 is still quickly growing in popularity. The number of active devices was up 50% year over year, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella told analysts on the company's earnings call in July.The Windows 11 2024 Update, also known as version 24H2, is meant to boost basic PC functions, such as downloading files over Wi-Fi, compressing documents and managing energy use. Here are some of the other new capabilities coming to PCs that can run Windows 11 in version 24H2:More energy consumption controls. You'll have an option to reduce the power draw of your PC while it's plugged in, even if it doesn't have a battery.Supercharged hearing aids. If you have hearing aids that support Bluetooth LE Audio, you'll be able to connect them to your computer and directly stream audio and adjust volume levels and balance.Faster internet. There's a new kind of router that adheres to the Wi-Fi 7 standard, and these devices can send data at a higher throughput than Wi-Fi 6 and Wi-Fi 6E. Your PC should now be able to make the most of these routers at home or at the office, so you can download files more rapidly and have more devices running at high speed.Simpler Wi-Fi sharing. In the Settings app, you'll be able to bring up a QR code showing information for logging on to your Wi-Fi network, so you can quickly get other devices connected.Rich backgrounds. If your device or display supports high dynamic range, or HDR, signals, then you can select an image file that uses the .JXR file extension and make it your desktop background. The result will make for higher contrast between light and dark parts of an image.Control mobile files. If you connect your phone to your PC over Bluetooth, you'll be able to turn on a control in the Settings app that will show files on your phone in a folder inside the File Explorer app. It's a wireless alternative to connecting your phone to your PC with a USB cable.Smaller clock. You can make the time take up less space in the System tray. To do this, open the Settings app, select Time & language. Under \"Show time and date in the System tray,\" you'll find a new option that says, \"Show abbreviated time and date.\"Compression choices. You won't have to download a program from the web if you want to bundle up your files in the 7-Zip or .tar format. Select a group of files in File Explorer, right-click, hover over \"Compress to...\" and then select from the ZIP, 7z or TAR options. Or you can pick \"Additional options,\" which brings up a box where you can increase or decrease the compression level and choose a compression method. To find version 24H2 of Windows 11, open the Settings app and go to Windows Update. The update will show up for you to download when Microsoft expects that your device will be ready for it. The company will first push 24H2 out to devices running versions 22H2 and 23H2 that have the \"Get the latest updates as soon as they're available\" option in Windows Update turned on.Schools and companies that want to distribute version 24H2 to their devices can consult a Microsoft blog post.WATCH: DA Davidson's Gil Luria explains his Microsoft downgrade " }, { "page": "https://www.cnbc.com/technology/?page=1", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/01/india-to-fabricate-its-first-chip-in-two-years-as-companies-pledge-to-expand-in-the-country.html", "date": "Tue, Oct 1st 2024", "author": "Seema Mody", "title": "India to fabricate its first chip in two years as companies pledge to expand to the country", "content": "India will fabricate its first chip in two years, Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal told CNBC during a one-on-one interview in New York.India's push into semiconductors comes as more U.S. chipmakers set their sights on India.

Owning multiple subscriptions can make it difficult to cancel them as consumers can end up losing track of which subscriptions they're paying for and when.Mastercard noted that this can have a negative impact on merchants because consumers who aren't able to easily cancel their subscriptions end up calling on their banks to request a block on payments being taken. According to Juniper Research data, there are 6.8 billion subscriptions globally, a number that's expected to jump to 9.3 billion by 2028.Financial services incumbents such as Mastercard have been rapidly growing their product suite to remain competitive with emerging fintech players that are offering more convenient, digitally native ways to manage consumers' money management needs.In 2020, Mastercard acquired Finicity, a U.S. fintech firm that enables third parties \u2014\u00a0such as fintechs or other banks \u2014\u00a0to gain access to consumers' banking information and make payments on their behalf.Earlier this year, the company announced that by 2030, it would tokenize all cards issued on its network in Europe \u2014 in other words, as a consumer, you wouldn't need to enter your card details manually anymore and would only have to use your thumbprint to authenticate your identity when you pay.Visa, meanwhile, is also trying to remain competitive with fintech challengers.

The total, which includes assets acquired under finance leases, was up from $14 billion in the March quarter and was as much as Microsoft shelled out in the entire 2020 fiscal year.\"It's an insane ramp,\" said Charles Fitzgerald, a former Microsoft manager who writes about capital expenditures on his blog Platformonomics.Investors will get further clarity on Microsoft's lease finances when the company reports fiscal first-quarter results in late October. Executives at Microsoft and other top tech companies have approved higher capital expenditures in the past two years, often to boost their performance in generative AI.Last month Microsoft confirmed its participation in a fund to back the development of data centers and the necessary energy infrastructure, mainly in the U.S. It also signed a 20-year power purchase agreement to restart a reactor at the Three Mile Island nuclear plant in Pennsylvania. Microsoft's higher costs in the June quarter weren't a surprise to those who heeded finance chief Amy Hood's guidance from April. She said for the third time in a year that Microsoft was expecting capital expenditures to grow \"materially.\"Still, RBC Capital Markets' Rishi Jaluria was caught off guard by the finance lease figure.\"I'm always on the side that capital leases and capital expenditures are going to be way higher than people think, but they exceeded my own expectations,\" Jaluria said. \"Frankly, I'm trusting Microsoft here.\" A capital lease is another term for a finance lease.Microsoft has said it achieves the best performance and the best cost when it's building data centers from scratch. But sometimes the company needs additional capacity immediately, and finance leases can help Microsoft obtain it more quickly.The pace has been frenetic since OpenAI introduced ChatGPT in late 2022. Microsoft supplies computing power to OpenAI, meaning the startup needs enough servers packed with Nvidia graphics processing units to keep ChatGPT online.With ChatGPT and other OpenAI services becoming even more popular, Microsoft has signed up additional cloud providers, including CoreWeave and Oracle. UBS analysts wrote in a report in September that comments Hood made in January suggest that Microsoft's finance leases include the relationships with CoreWeave and Oracle.Microsoft declined to comment on where third-party cloud partnerships show up on its financial statements.Jaluria said investors don't pay attention to backlogs for capital leases. Microsoft doesn't specify when they will kick in or how long they will last, making them less immediate than in-quarter capital expenditures.CEO Satya Nadella normally defers to Hood when analysts ask financial questions on earnings calls. But in July, Nadella stepped up when an analyst asked about the strategy of forming partnerships with other cloud providers that supplement Microsoft's direct data center spending.\"To me it's no different than leases that we've already done in the past,\" Nadella said. \"You could even say sometimes buying from Oracle may be even more efficient leases because they are even shorter date.\"When it comes to the jump in capital expenditures and future finance leases, Jaluria said investors just have to accept that they will weigh on profitability.\"Naturally, margins are coming down,\" said Jaluria, who has the equivalent of a buy rating on the stock. \"The cost is here now, and the benefits are not here to offset it. And I think that's OK.\" WATCH: 2025-2028 will be big CapEx years for the hyperscalers, says Alger's Ankur Crawford " }, { "page": "https://www.cnbc.com/technology/?page=1", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/01/assassins-creed-maker-ubisoft-ubi-faces-questions-over-its-future.html", "date": "Tue, Oct 1st 2024", "author": "Ryan Browne", "title": "With shares at 10-year lows, Ubisoft faces questions over its future", "content": "French video game publisher Ubisoft is facing questions over its future, as it grapples with a lackluster games pipeline and pressure from investors to seek a sale.The company, which produces the \"Assassin's Creed\" franchise, said in updated guidance last week that it has postponed the release of the next title in the popular game series \u2014 called \"Assassin's Creed Shadows\" \u2014 by three months to Feb. 14, 2025.Ubisoft also cut its guidance for the 2024-2025 fiscal year, saying it now expects net bookings to fall to around 1.95 billion euros. Ubisoft said it expects net bookings for its fiscal second quarter to come in at 350 million to 370 million euros, down from 500 million euros anticipated previously.\"The revised targets are mainly a reflection of decisions taken for Assassin's Creed Shadows and the softer than expected launch for Star Wars Outlaws,\" Ubisoft said.It comes after the company's \"Star Wars Outlaws\" game \u2014 an action-adventure title based on the iconic sci-fi movie series, which was released this summer \u2014 was met with disappointing sales performance and a mixed reception from gamers. Ubisoft said that its learnings from the Star Wars Outlaws release pushed it to give more time to polish Assassin's Creed Shadows.The company said it was also scrapping plans to release its new Assassin's Creed game with a \"Season Pass,\" which was a paid add-on providing access to a bonus quest and additional downloadable content at launch.Ubisoft added that it now plans to release Assassin's Creed Shadows on Valve Corporation's online games store Steam on the day of its launch, ending its track record of exclusively distributing PC versions of its games on Epic Games' digital storefront. \"In the light of recent challenges, we acknowledge the need for greater efficiency while delighting players,\" Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot said in the statement last week, adding that the company's executive committee is launching a review to further improve its execution.Ubisoft shares have slumped to decade-lows against this backdrop of dismal investor expectations about its triple-A games pipeline and financial prospects.To further compound the business' woes, the company is facing possible strike action in France after the country's STJV video game workers' union called for three days of industrial action on Oct. 15-17 over the company's bid to get workers back in the office three days a week. Following the decision to delay its upcoming Assassin's Creed game, AJ Investments, an activist investor with a less than 1% stake in Ubisoft, said that it was working with other shareholders in the company to push the French firm to sell itself to private equity firms or to Chinese gaming giant Tencent.Tencent owns a roughly 10% stake in Ubisoft. In an open letter last week, AJ Investments said it had gathered the support of 10% of Ubisoft shareholders for its pressure campaign, adding that it intends to cooperate with proxy advisory firms in preparation for voting at the company's next general meeting. CNBC could not independently verify this figure.\"We have talked to industry experts as potential boards members and executives to replace current management and realise our strategy targets, we will propose our candidates due time,\" AJ Investments said.AJ Investments noted it is due to speak with Ubisoft management on Tuesday to discuss its proposals. The firm added it would demonstrate in front of Ubisoft's headquarters in Montreuil, Paris, if needed.Several bank analysts slashed their price targets for Ubisoft after news of the delays to its upcoming game, although many kept their ratings unchanged.Deutsche Bank, which downgrade the stock to \"hold\" from \"buy,\" said that Ubisoft's guidance cut was \"bigger than we expected\" and that the postponement to Assassin's Creed Shadows \"pushes a substantial amount of revenue\" out into the next fiscal year.Deutsche Bank's George Brown also said he anticipated Assassin's Creed Shadows will perform worse than he expected initially, forecasting unit sales of 7 million in the 12-month period following release. That's down from a projection of 8 million, previously. Meanwhile, JPMorgan said in a note last week that they now expect lower unit sales of Ubisoft's triple-A game releases and see a slower cadence of releases moving forward. JPMorgan maintained its \"neutral\" rating on Ubisoft stock, but cut its price target to 11 euros from 21 euros.\"Mid-size developers continue to be squeezed by development cost inflation which has not been matched by sufficient volume/ monetization improvement to sustain attractive returns,\" JPMorgan analysts Daniel Kerven and David W Peat said in the note.\"UBI's capital structure and lack of cash generation in recent years have left it under increasing pressure to cut investments/costs.\" Still, some analysts were more sympathetic to Ubisoft's struggles.Analysts at Wedbush Securities suggested the firm had become the victim of coordinated \"trolling\" from people trying to force down user score averages for the company's Star Wars Outlaws game on review sites. \"We believe Star Wars Outlaws was impacted by a coordinated effort that sought to troll Ubisoft games specifically and Star Wars content in general,\" Wedbush analysts Michael Pachter, Alicia Reese and Kade Bar wrote in the note last week.\"The game received an unusual number of user reviews with a clear negative bias (including a large percentage of \"zero\" reviews), despite seeing acceptable review scores from reputable review sites. This is a case of a rare incel victory that led to Ubisoft having to take down its numbers,\" they added.Wedbush's analysts said that, despite delays to its upcoming Assassin's Creed title, they expect the game to sell 7 million units in its launch quarter and think it has \"potential to be one of Ubisoft's best sellers ever.\" Ubisoft's woes comes as the broader video games space is facing an industry-wide slump.The global games market is set to grow only 2.1% year-over-year in 2024, according to research firm Newzoo. That's up from 0.5% growth in 2023, but no where near the surging growth levels witnessed during the 2020 and 2021 Covid-19 pandemic years.James Lockyer, technology research analyst at U.K. investment bank Peel Hunt, said that part of the problem for game publishers today is that gamers are devoting more of their time to older games than to newer titles.\"In the years that followed Covid, the number of games released per year has grown substantially,\" Lockyer told CNBC via email. \"Consequently, consumers have had more choice over the last couple of years.\"\"However, more choice plus a cost-of-living squeezed wallet has meant consumers' cash has been spread more thinly, leading to revenues and ROIs [return on investment] of those games often coming out below expectations,\" he added.

But Chriss confidently said he was prepared to \"shock the world.\"\"I love being an underdog,\" Chriss said in an interview on \"Squawk on the Street,\" from the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. He was responding to a question about a recent spate of analyst downgrades.Dan Dolev of Mizuho Securities was among the skeptics. He cut his rating to the equivalent of a hold on Jan. 16, the day before Chriss' CNBC appearance, headlining his report, \"PayPal faces competitive pressure from 'A' to 'Z.'\" The A was for Apple Pay, and the Z represented payments app Zelle, a money transfer service jointly owned by seven of the top U.S. banks.A few weeks later, PayPal issued weak guidance in its fourth-quarter earnings report, knocking the stock down 11% and justifying Dolev's concerns.PayPal appeared to be in deep trouble. Its market cap was down more than 80% since peaking in mid-2021. The company had just cut 9% of it workforce, about 2,500 jobs, and was mired in single-digit growth. Analysts across Wall Street saw rising competition and a declining take rate, or the percentage of revenue PayPal keeps from each transaction.Fast forward to today, and the picture is dramatically brighter for the 26-year-old Silicon Valley company and its 47-year-old CEO.Chriss hit his one-year anniversary at the helm on Friday. In the third quarter, which ended on Monday, PayPal shares jumped 34%, their biggest quarterly rally since mid-2020, when the early days of the Covid pandemic fueled a surge in online shopping. It was the first time in eight quarters that PayPal outperformed the Nasdaq, which gained just 2.6% in the past three months. Dolev bolstered his rating back to a buy in May. In July, the company lifted its full-year profit forecast for a second time and increased share repurchases. Chriss said in the earnings release that the company was now \"operating from a position of strength.\" The stock rose almost 9%, its best day since late 2022.\"I think he's been nothing but a phenomenal success story so far,\" Dolev said. \"The news flow has been out of this world amazing, in terms of the way they manage expectations.\"Susquehanna's James Friedman lifted his rating on PayPal to a buy in early July. He said Chriss was \"setting the bar high\" with his comments on CNBC, but said he's been delivering on his bold promise to shareholders.\"You know how he shocked the world?\" Friedman said. \"He actually beat his numbers.\"Much of Chriss' early success has been tied to improved transaction margins and better monetization of key acquisitions like Braintree, which is used by Meta for credit card processing, and payments app Venmo, which is becoming more popular with businesses.Having cut a lot of the fat in the organization and with a renewed focus on profitability, Chriss has finally sparked some excitement on Wall Street after succeeded Dan Schulman, who retired following almost a decade as CEO.\"It was time for some new blood at PayPal,\" said Dana Stalder, a startup investor at venture firm Matrix Partners who served as PayPal's commercial chief from 2004 to 2008. \"He's made a lot of changes very quickly, and I think he has substantially increased the focus on the consumer, which is the right thing.\" Now comes the harder part \u2014 reigniting growth.Analysts are projecting roughly 6% revenue growth when PayPal reports third-quarter results in about a month, according to LSEG. For the fourth quarter, they expect growth of 5.5%. Sales are only expected to get marginally stronger in 2024, with analysts expecting growth of under 8% for the full year.PayPal didn't make Chriss available for an interview for this story.In the July earnings call, Chriss said of the firm's next steps that \"while change takes time and we still have much work ahead of us, we are well positioned today, have the right leadership in place and are moving full steam ahead.\"Chriss, who spent 19 years at tax software provider Intuit before joining PayPal, took little time before he started overhauling the management team. In November, he brought in Isabel Cruz from Walmart as chief people officer, Michelle Gill from Intuit to run a new small business and financial services group, Diego Scotti from Verizon to oversee the consumer group as well as marketing and communications, and Jamie Miller from EY as CFO.\"He has turned over, from what I can tell, the vast majority of the leadership team,\" Stalder said. \"It's been wholesale changes.\" Early in his tenure, Chriss publicly identified some of the reasons, in his view, that PayPal had been struggling to find its footing. He highlighted an overly aggressive strategy of expansion through deal-making.\"We have done too many acquisitions over the last few years, and we've been defocused,\" Chriss said in the January interview with Faber. \"It was one of the things I noticed when I came in 100 days ago.\"Chriss added that the company had narrowed down its priorities to five key things, \"all focused on profitable growth.\"The most important metric to fix, he said, was transaction margin dollars, which is how the company gauges the profitability of its core business. Among Chriss' strategies to address the deteriorating margin was to offer merchants increased value-added services, such as connecting a couple of data points at checkout to drive down the rate of cart abandonment.He said in January that 35 million merchants use PayPal and \"when we improve their conversion rate, it improves their business, it improves our bottom line.\"PayPal noted to shareholders in its latest earnings report that its branded checkout, along with Braintree and Venmo, helped the company achieve its highest growth rate in transaction margin dollars since 2021. Overall transaction margin dollars increased 8% to $3.6 billion.Susquehanna's Friedman says a career at Intuit is the perfect training ground for learning how to mastermind a stock recovery. Speaking to executives there is like \"talking to a dashboard,\" he said.\"The source code to engineer a higher stock is profitability,\" Friedman said. Chriss \"really boils down his management style to the things that count\" and \"reducing what's irrelevant,\" he added.With Venmo, the goal is to turn one of the most popular choices for money transfer from a strictly consumer app, which has no transaction fees, to a product for merchants. DoorDash, Starbucks and Ticketmaster are among businesses now accepting Venmo as one way that consumers can pay. Getting competitive at the point of sale is another big priority. That's led PayPal to Will Ferrell.The company launched a national campaign last month for PayPal Everywhere, offering 5% cash back for using a PayPal debit card within the mobile app. Ferrell, the pitchman, can be seen in a commercial using the PayPal app to buy lemonade and gas, while singing a parody of Fleetwood Mac's \"Everywhere.\"Stalder says PayPal is way behind Apple and Google, which own the dominant smartphone operating systems with their own embedded digital wallets.\"PayPal has been stuck because it's less convenient than the mobile wallets, No. 1,\" Stalder said. \"And No. 2, it hasn't worked offline.\"But Stalder sees a real opportunity for PayPal, in part because Apple has just opened the Secure Element on iOS so that other developers can more easily use the phone for contactless payments, putting them on a more equal plane with Apple Pay.That development allows PayPal to \"ride the mobile wallet rails for the first time and make some real headway in offline payments,\" Stalder said. PayPal's other point-of-sale effort is called Fastlane, a one-click payment option for online sales that can go head-to-head with Apple Pay and Shop Pay by Shopify. In August, fintech platform Adyen made Fastlane available to businesses in the U.S., and said it plans to expand the offering globally in the future.Chriss told investors on the earnings call that the company is urgently pushing to meet the holiday rush.\"We need to get it on as many platforms as we can so that small businesses in particular can just one-click a button and turn it on for the holidays,\" Chriss said. \"We're working with many of our large enterprises who want access to this before the holidays as well.\" Chriss' long history at Intuit gave him an intimate understanding of the expansive world of small- and medium-sized businesses. That experience could be crucial as PayPal targets SMBs with its various payment and checkout options.Sanjay Sakhrani, an analyst at KBW, said going further down market allows PayPal to command better economics because there's so much more competition when going after enterprises.\"To the extent that they can broaden their reach there, I think that could be quite lucrative,\" said Sakhrani, who has a buy rating on the stock.Chriss calls SMBs an \"untapped opportunity for us,\" adding on the earnings call that those companies don't want to \"piece together 17 different solutions.\"\"Small businesses are \u2013 they're fighting for every customer,\" Chriss said in July. \"They need to be able to find customers. They need to be able to engage with customers, convert them, and then reengage with them.\"Venture capitalist Oren Zeev has seen Chriss work with small businesses in another capacity. They served together on the board of home design startup Houzz, whose customers include a lot of architects and contractors.\"He obviously brought a lot to the table with his vast experience with small businesses,\" Zeev said. As a communicator, Zeev described Chriss as \"no drama\" and \"respected by everyone.\"While he's quickly captured the respect of investors, who have lifted PayPal's market cap by over $20 billion in the year since Chriss started, there's a lot more to do.The stock remains about 75% below its record high. Sakhrani says shareholders are \"anxiously awaiting his multiple-year outlook\" as opposed to just \"trying to fix some of the stuff that was broken.\"\"There's going to be some pressure at some point in time, in the near future, for more definition around that,\" Sakhrani said.Chriss, for his part, isn't declaring victory.\"Our teams are moving with urgency, excited about our innovation and focused on execution,\" he said on the second-quarter earnings call. \"We are still early in our transformation and while pleased with our progress in many areas, we know there is much more we can do and with greater speed.\" WATCH: PayPal's crypto lead on allowing merchants to buy and sell virtual assets " }, { "page": "https://www.cnbc.com/technology/?page=1", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/01/freetrade-buys-uk-arm-of-australian-investing-platform-stake.html", "date": "Tue, Oct 1st 2024", "author": "Ryan Browne", "title": "Robinhood rival Freetrade buys UK arm of Australian investing platform Stake", "content": "London-based online trading platform Freetrade told CNBC Tuesday that it's agreed to buy the U.K. customer book of Stake, an Australian investing app.The move is part of a broader bid from Freetrade to bolster its domestic business and comes as British digital investment platforms face rising competition from new entrants \u2014\u00a0not least U.S. heavyweight Robinhood.The startup told CNBC exclusively that it entered into a transaction with Stake to take on all of the company's clients and move all assets the firm manages in the U.K. over to its own platform.Freetrade and Stake declined to disclose financial information of the deal, including the value of Stake's U.K. customer book.Stake, which is based in Sydney, Australia, was founded in 2017 by entrepreneurs Matt Leibowitz, Dan Silver and Jon Abitz with the aim of providing low-cost brokerage services to retail investors in Australia.The company, which also operates in New Zealand, launched its services in the U.K. in 2020. However, after a recent business review, Stake decided to focus primarily on its Australia and New Zealand operations.Following the deal, customers of Stake U.K. will be contacted with details about how to move their money and other assets over to Freetrade in \"the coming weeks,\" the companies said. Customers will still be able to use their Stake account until assets and cash are transferred to Freetrade in November. Freetrade operates primarily in the U.K. but has sought to expand into the European Union. It offers a range of investment products on its platform, including stocks, exchange-traded funds, individual savings\u00a0accounts, and government bonds. As of April 2024, it had more than 1.4 million users.Earlier this year, CNBC reported that the startup's co-founder and CEO, Adam Dodds, had decided to depart the company after six years at the helm. He was replaced by Viktor Nebehaj, the firm's then-chief operating officer.Freetrade was a beneficiary of the 2020 and 2021 retail stock investing frenzy, which saw GameStop and other so-called \"meme stocks\" jump to wild highs. In the years that followed, Freetrade and its rivals, including Robinhood were impacted by higher interest rates which hammered investor sentiment.In 2022, Freetrade announced plans to lay off 15% of its workforce. The following year, the firm saw its valuation slump 65% to \u00a3225 million ($301 million) in an equity crowdfunding round. Freetrade at the time blamed a \"different market environment\" for the reduction in its market value.More recently, though, things have been turning around for the startup. Freetrade reported its first-ever half year of profit in 2024, with adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization hitting \u00a391,000 in the six months through June. Revenues climbed 34% year-over-year, to \u00a313.1 million.\"I'm focused on scaling Freetrade into the leading commission-free investment platform in the UK market,\" CEO Nebehaj said in a statement shared with CNBC. \"This deal shows our commitment to capitalise on opportunities for inorganic growth to reach that goal.\"\"Over the last few months, we have worked closely with Stake to ensure a smooth transition and good outcomes for their UK customers. We look forward to welcoming them and continuing to support them on their investment journeys.\"Freetrade currently manages more than \u00a32 billion worth of assets for U.K. clients. Globally, Stake has over $2.9 billion in assets under administration.Robinhood, a far larger player in the U.S. with $144 billion in assets under management, launched in the U.K. in November 2023 to much fanfare. Earlier this month, the company launched a securities lending scheme in the U.K., in a bid to further entice prospective British clients.

The service allowed users to buy and sell cryptocurrencies, but not to move them away from the platform, either to another third-party platform or to their own self-custodial wallet.Johann Kerbrat, general manager of Robinhood's crypto unit, told CNBC that he thinks the EU has the potential to become an attractive market for digital currencies, thanks to crypto-friendly regulations being adopted by the bloc.\"The EU can become a very attractive market next year,\" Kerbrat said in an interview. He pointed to the EU's landmark Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA), regulation, which sets out harmonized rules for the crypto sector across all 27 of the bloc's member states.Once MiCA is fully in place, Kerbrat said, every EU country will fall under the same unified regime.\"In terms of total addressable market, [the EU] is as big as the U.S.,\" he told CNBC, adding, \"it's definitely an interesting market for us.\"Robinhood added that, for a limited time, the company will offer European customers the ability to get 1% of the value of tokens deposited on its platform back in the form of the equivalent cryptocurrency they transfer into Robinhood.Robinhood is rolling out new features in the EU at a time when U.S. crypto firms are sparring with regulators at home. In the U.S., the Securities and Exchange Commission has sued several companies including Coinbase, Binance and Ripple over claims that they're all dealing in unregistered securities. Each of the platforms has contested the SEC's allegations, stipulating that tokens marketed and sold on their platforms don't quality as securities that should be registered with the agency.\"We are disappointed by the way U.S. regulation is happening, where it's basically regulation by enforcement,\" Kerbret told CNBC. \"We are not super happy to see that.\"Robinhood is regulated by the SEC and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) at a federal level in the U.S. It also holds a BitLicense with New York State Department of Financial Services. In June, Robinhood announced that it would acquire Luxembourg-based crypto platform Bitstamp to take advantage of the firm's exchange technology and further expand its reach globally. The deal, which is valued at approximately $200 million in cash, is set to close in the first half of 2025.Kerbrat said that the company's deal to buy Bitstamp would help it gain access to even more international markets and obtain coveted regulatory permissions around the world. Bitstamp holds over 50 licenses and registrations globally including in Singapore, the U.K. and the EU.Beyond expanding globally, the deal with Bitstamp is also expected to help Robinhood diversify its crypto business to serve more institutional investors, Kerbrat told CNBC. For example, Bitstamp offers a \"crypto-as-a-service\" offering which helps banks and other financial firms launch their own crypto capabilities.Robinhood's crypto trading, deposit and withdrawal functionality are currently only available to customers in the European Union, not in the U.K. The company launched its popular stock trading service to Brits in November last year. However, it does not yet currently offer crypto services to U.K. clients.

Because there's no way any market can have that many players. So it's going to happen, it's bound to happen.\" Dhawan said he's finding there's a bit of a \"bid-ask spread\" in the market currently when it comes to cybersecurity opportunities, meaning target companies are asking for more money at the sale price than the valuations they're being offered. But he added that he's seeing some \"great opportunities\" in the market.A key priority for Proofpoint as it hunts for M&A targets is geographic expansion, Dhawan noted, adding that the company sees major growth opportunities in non-English speaking countries like Japan, South Korea and the Middle East, where cyber breaches are skyrocketing due to the rise of generative AI.The number of business email compromise attacks grew by 35% in Japan, 31% in South Korea, and 29% in the United Arab Emirates, according to figures shared by Proofpoint with CNBC. This is happening because generative AI is making it easier for hackers to personalize emails in multiple languages, according to Dhawan. Founded in 2002 in Silicon Valley, Proofpoint makes technology that helps companies prevent phishing attempts and other cyberattacks across a range of platforms, including email, social media, mobile devices, and the cloud.The company competes with the likes of Palo Alto Networks, CrowdStrike and Fortinet, all three of which have seen their shares rise sharply in the past 12 months. CrowdStrike \u2014\u00a0the company that caused a global IT outage this year due to a software issue \u2014\u00a0is up 65% year-over-year.Palo Alto Networks and Fortinet shares are up 44% and 32% respectively over the same period.Proofpoint went public in the U.S. in 2012, but subsequently delisted after Thoma Bravo acquired the company in a $12.3 billion deal in 2021. The buyout came after investor concerns over a deceleration in revenue growth.Now, Proofpoint is once again looking to tap the public markets.\"We are a little bit different from typical companies going to IPO,\" Dhawan said. \"They tend to be smaller. They tend to have a very different profile. They tend to have uncertainty in terms of profitability, and they tend to not be in position to easily consolidate.\"Taking Proofpoint public wouldn't mark the first time a company Thoma Bravo acquired in a private equity buyout has done an IPO for a second time. In 2019, cybersecurity firm Dynatrace, which Thoma Bravo took private in a 2014 buyout, went public again in a New York listing. Proofpoint could go through \"multiple rounds\" of financing to expand ownership of the company by other private equity investors, Dhawan told CNBC, adding that private placements \u2014 sales of shares to pre-selected investors as opposed to general sales to the public \u2014 are among options it's considering.\"We're close to starting the process\" for fundraising from investors beyond its private equity owners, Dhawan said. However, he stressed the firm hasn't officially set off this process.Proofpoint's boss said he hopes that what separates his company from other tech and cybersecurity firms seeking a similar IPO route, is a good balance of growth and profitability, double-digit growth, and strong leadership in its market.

Cerebras says on its website that its WSE-3 chip comes with more cores and memory than Nvidia's popular H100. It's also a physically larger chip. In addition to selling chips, Cerebras offers cloud-based services that rely on its own computing clusters.Cerebras had a net loss of $66.6 million in the first six months of 2024 on $136.4 million in sales, according to the filing. For the fist six months of 2023, the company had a net loss of $77.8 million and $8.7 million in sales.For the full year of 2023, Cerebras reported a net loss of $127.2 million on revenue of $78.7 million.The company reported a net loss of $50.9 million on $69.8 million in revenue in the second quarter, compared with a $26.2 million loss and $5.7 million in revenue in the same period a year earlier.Operating expenses have increased this year in part because of higher personnel costs to support revenue growth, the company said.AI chips are a growing and crowded market. Cloud providers Amazon, Google and Microsoft have developed their own AI chips. The company said that Group 42, a UAE-based AI firm that counts Microsoft as an investor, accounted for 83% of Cerebras's revenue last year. In addition to Nvidia, Cerebras cites AMD, Intel, Microsoft and Google as competitors, \"as well as internally developed custom application-specific integrated circuits and a variety of private companies.\"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company makes the Cerebras chips. Cerebrus warned investors that any possible supply chain disruptions may hurt the company.Cerebras was founded in 2016 and is based in Sunnyvale, California. Andrew Feldman, the startup's co-founder and CEO, sold server startup SeaMicro to AMD for $355 million in 2012.The company said in 2021 that it was valued at over $4 billion in a $250 million funding round.In May, G42 committed to purchasing $1.43 billion in orders from Cerebras before March 2025, according to the filing.\u00a0G42 currently owns under 5% of Cerebras' Class A shares, and the firm has an option to purchase more depending on how much Cerebras product it buys.The technology IPO market has generally been sparse in 2024, as higher interest rates pushed investors toward profitable assets. Social media app Reddit went public on the New York Stock Exchange in March, and data management software maker Rubrik followed in April. Earlier this month, the Federal Reserve pushed ahead with its first rate cut since 2020, prompting gains in the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index.Neither Morgan Stanley nor Goldman Sachs, the two leading tech investment banks, are on the deal. Citigroup and Barclays are leading the offering.The biggest investor in Cerebras is venture firm Foundation Capital, followed by Benchmark and Eclipse Ventures. Alpha Wave, Coatue and Altimeter each own at least 5% as well, according to the filing. Other investors include OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Sun Microsystems co-founder Andy Bechtolsheim. The only individual who owns 5% or more is Feldman.WATCH: Cerebras CEO: Our inference offering is 20x faster than Nvidia's and a fraction of the price " }, { "page": "https://www.cnbc.com/technology/?page=1", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/30/google-to-invest-1-billion-in-thailand-data-center-and-ai-push.html", "date": "Mon, Sep 30th 2024", "author": "Ryan Browne", "title": "Google to invest $1 billion in Thailand to build data center, accelerate AI tech", "content": "Google announced Monday it is investing 36 billion Thai baht, or $1 billion, into Thailand for the creation of a new data center and expansion of the country's cloud infrastructure.The move marks a ramp-up of Google's expansion in Asia, putting artificial intelligence at the heart of its international push at a time when it is facing intense competition from companies such as Microsoft and OpenAI.The investment would see the company create its first data center in Thailand, Google said in a post on its Thailand blog Monday.Data centers are the backbone of today's modern digital economy, fueling the rise of cloud computing technology that enables access to storage, compute and analytics services via the internet.Google said its debut Thai data center will be located in Chonburi, an eastern province of Thailand.The facility will \"help support the growing demand for Google Cloud and AI innovations, as well as popular Google services such as Google Search, Google Maps and Google Workspace\" in Thailand, Jackie Wang, Google's Thailand country lead, said in the blog post, according to an English translation taken via Google Translate.Beyond developing infrastructure, the $1 billion investment from Google into Thailand is \"also about unlocking new opportunities for businesses, educators and all Thais,\" Wang said in the blog post.\"As AI transforms industries, it is more important than ever to educate and upskill Thais to use this technology,\" she added.Thailand's digital economy is the second-largest in Southeast Asia and is expected to reach $50 billion by 2025, Google, Temasek and Bain & Company said in a 2023 report by e-Conomy SEA.Google is investing in the region with a focus on AI as it faces pressure from its rival tech giants when it comes to both AI and cloud computing.The internet giant currently dominates globally when it comes to its search engine technology. But the firm has increasingly come under threat from the surge of generative AI tools such as OpenAI's ChatGPT.It is a technology that Google helped pioneer through its early research on so-called transformer models, which are the bedrock of many of the most-popular generative AI models.However, today Google finds itself under threat from the use of generative AI products, such as ChatGPT and Perplexity, an AI-powered search engine, to find information about things.Last week, Google filed an antitrust lawsuit with the European Commission accusing Microsoft of abusing its dominant position in the cloud industry to undermine competition.

But even though many people know they should stay away from free Wi-Fi, it proves as irresistible to travelers as it is to hackers, who are now updating an old cybercrime tactic to take advantage.An arrest in Australia over the summer set off alarm bells in the United States that cybercriminals are finding new ways to profit from what are called \"evil twin\" attacks. Also classified within a type of cybercrime called\u00a0\"Man in the Middle\"\u00a0attacks, evil twinning occurs when a hacker or hacking group sets up a\u00a0fake Wi-Fi network, most often in public settings where many users can be expected to connect.In this instance, an Australian man was charged with conducting a Wi-Fi attack on domestic flights and airports in Perth, Melbourne, and Adelaide.\u00a0He allegedly set up a fake Wi-Fi network to steal email or social media credentials.\"As the general population becomes more accustomed to free Wi-Fi everywhere, you can expect evil twinning attacks to become more common,\" said Matt Radolec, vice president of incident response and cloud operations at data security firm Varonis, adding that no one reads the terms and conditions or checks the URLs on free Wi-Fi.\"It's almost a game to see how fast you can click \"accept\" and then 'sign in' or 'connect.' This is the ploy, especially when visiting a new location; a user might not even know what a legitimate site should look like when presented with a fake site,\"\u00a0Radolec said.Today's 'evil twins' can more easily hideOne of the dangers of today's twinning attacks is that the technology is much easier to disguise. An evil twin can be a tiny device and can be tucked behind a display in a coffee shop, and the small device can have a significant impact.\"A device like this can serve up a compelling copy of a valid login page, which could invite unwary device users to enter their username and password, which would then be collected for future exploitation,\" said Cincinnati-based IT consultant Brian Alcorn.\u00a0The site doesn't even have to actually log you in. \"Once you've entered your information, the deed is done,\" Alcorn said, adding that a harried, weary traveler probably would just think the airport Wi-Fi is having issues and not give it another thought.\u00a0\u00a0People who are not careful with passwords, such as use of pet's names or favorite sports teams as their password for everything, are even more vulnerable to an evil twin attack. Alcorn says for individuals who reuse username and password combinations online, once the credentials are obtained they can be fed into AI, where its power can quickly give cybercriminals the key.\"You are susceptible to exploitation by someone with less than $500 in equipment and less skill than you might imagine,\" Alcorn said. \"The attacker just has to be motivated with basic IT skills.\"How to avoid becoming a victim of this cybercrimeWhen in public places, experts say it's best to use alternatives to public WiFi networks.\"My favorite way to avoid evil twin attacks is to use your phone's mobile hotspot if possible,\" said Brian Callahan, Director of the Rensselaer Cybersecurity Collaboratory at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.Users would be able to spot an attack if through a phone relying on its mobile data and sharing it via a mobile hotspot.\"You will know the name of that network since you made it, and you can put a strong password that only you know on it to connect,\" Callahan said.If a hotspot isn't an option, a VPN can also provide some protection, Callahan said, as traffic should be encrypted to and from the VPN.\"So even if someone else can see the data, they can't do anything about it,\" he said.Airport, airline internet security issuesAt many airports, the responsibility for WiFi is outsourced and the airport itself has little if any involvement in safeguarding it. At Dallas Fort Worth International Airport, for example, Boingo is the Wi-Fi provider.\"The airport's IT team does not have access to their systems, nor can we see usage and dashboards,\" For said an airport spokesman. \"The network is isolated from DAL's systems as it is a separate standalone system with no direct connection to any of the City of\u00a0Dallas' networks or systems internally.\"\u00a0A spokeswoman for Boingo, which provides service to approximately 60 airports in North America, said it can identify rogue Wi-Fi access points through its network management. \"The best way passengers can be protected is by using Passpoint, which uses encryption to automatically connect users to authenticated Wi-Fi for a safe online experience,\" she said, adding that Boingo has offered Passpoint since 2012 to enhance Wi-Fi security and eliminate the risk of connecting to malicious hotspots.Alcorn says evil twin attacks are \"definitely\" occurring with regularity in the United States, it's just rare for someone to get caught because they are such stealth attacks.\u00a0 And sometimes hackers use these attacks as a learning model. \"Many evil twin attacks may be experimental by individuals with novice-to-intermediate skills just to see if they can do it and get away with it, even if they don't use the collected information right away,\" he said.The surprise in Australia wasn't the evil twinning attack itself, but the arrest.\"This incident isn't unique, but it is unusual that the suspect was arrested,\" said Aaron Walton, threat analyst at Expel, a managed services security company. \"Generally, airlines are not equipped and prepared to handle or mediate hacking accusations. The typical lack of arrests and punitive action should motivate travelers to exercise caution with their own data, knowing what a tempting and usually unguarded -target it is \u2014 especially at the airport.\"In the Australian case, according to Australian Federal Police, dozens of people had their credentials stolen.According to a press release from the AFP, \"When people tried to connect their devices to the free WiFi networks, they were taken to a fake webpage requiring them to sign in using their email or social media logins. Those details were then allegedly saved to the man's devices.\"\u00a0\u00a0Once those credentials were harvested, they could be used to extract more information from the victims, including bank account information.For hackers to be successful, they don't have to dupe everyone. If they can persuade only a handful of people \u2013 statistically easy to do when thousands of harried and hurried people are milling around an airport \u2013 they will succeed.\"We expect WI-Fi to be everywhere. When you go to a hotel, or an airport, or a coffee shop, or even just out and about, we expect there to be Wi-Fi and often freely available WI-FI,\" Callahan said. \"After all, what's yet another network name in the long list when you're at an airport? An attacker doesn't need everyone to connect to their evil twin, only some people who go on to put credentials into websites that can be stolen.\"The next time you're at the airport, the only way to be 100% sure you're safe is to bring your own Wi-Fi.

Earlier this month, X filed paperwork informing Brazil's supreme court that it is now in compliance with orders, which it previously defied.As Brazil's G1 Globo reported, X must now pay a new fine of 10 million reals (about $2 million) for two additional days of non-compliance with the court's orders. X's legal representative in Brazil, Rachel de Oliveira, is also required to pay a fine of 300,000 reals.The case dates back to April, when de Moraes, the minister of Brazil's supreme court, known as Supremo Tribunal Federal (STF), initiated a probe into Musk and X over alleged obstruction of justice.Musk had vowed to defy the court's orders to take down certain accounts in Brazil. He called the court's actions \"censorship,\" and railed online against de Moraes, describing the judge as a \"criminal\" and encouraging the U.S. to end\u00a0foreign aid\u00a0to Brazil.In mid-August, Musk closed down X offices in Brazil. That left his company without a legal representative in the country, a federal requirement for all tech platforms to do business there.By Aug. 28, de Moraes' court threatened a ban and fines if X didn't appoint a legal representative within 24 hours, and if it didn't comply with takedown requests for accounts the court said had engaged in plots to dox or harm federal agents, among other things.Earlier this month, the STF froze the business assets of Musk companies, including both X and satellite internet business Starlink, operating in Brazil. The STF said in court filings that it viewed Starlink parent SpaceX and X as companies that worked together as related parties.Musk wrote in\u00a0a post on X at that time that, \"Unless the Brazilian government returns the illegally seized property of and SpaceX, we will seek reciprocal seizure of government assets too.\" As head of the STF, de Moraes has long supported federal regulations to rein in hate speech and\u00a0misinformation online. His views have garnered pushback from tech companies and far-right officials in the country, along with former President Jair Bolsonaro and his supporters.Bolsonaro is under investigation, suspected of orchestrating a coup in Brazil after losing the 2022 presidential election to current President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.While Musk has called for retribution against de Moraes and Lula, he has worked with and praised Bolsonaro for years. The former president of Brazil authorized SpaceX to deliver satellite internet services commercially in Brazil in 2022.Musk bills himself as a free speech defender, but his track record suggests otherwise. Under his management, X removed content critical of ruling parties in\u00a0Turkey and India at the government's insistence. X agreed to more than 80% of government take-down requests in 2023 over a comparable period the prior year, according to analysis by the tech news site Rest of World.X faces increased competition in Brazil from social apps like Meta-owned Threads, and Bluesky, which have attracted users during its suspension.Starlink also faces competition in Brazil from eSpace, a French-American firm that gained permission this year from the National Telecommunications Agency (Anatel) to deliver satellite internet services in the country.Lukas Darien, an attorney and law professor at Brazil's Facex University Center, told CNBC that the STF's enforcement actions against X are likely to change the way large technology companies will view the court.\"There is no change to the law here,\" Darien wrote in a message. \"But specifically, big tech companies are now aware that the laws will be applied regardless of the size of a business and the magnitude of its reach in the country.\"Musk and representatives for X didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday.Late Thursday, X Global Government Affairs posted the following statement:\"X is committed to protecting free speech within the boundaries of the law and we recognize and respect the sovereignty of the countries in which we operate.

The company sells subscriptions to various tools and licenses its GPT family of large language models, which are powering much of the generative AI boom. Running those models requires a massive investment in Nvidia's graphics processing units.The Times, citing an analysis by a financial professional who reviewed OpenAI's documents, reported that the roughly $5 billion in loses this year are tied to costs for running its services as well as employee salaries and office rent.

And unlike VR headsets that can be cumbersome to wear for extended periods, Boorstin said she found the Orion glasses to be a good fit.\"The form factor didn't feel meaningfully different than wearing a pair of heavy, ordinary glasses, and they were not uncomfortable to wear,\" she said.Though the current incarnation of the Orion AR glasses could pass as a movie prop for the film \"Revenge of the Nerds,\" Boorstin said she believes they're only going to get smaller as technology improves.\"This is the first generation \u2014 four years from now, how much smaller will they be?\" Boorstin said.When wearing the AR glasses, Boorstin was able to see digital holograms displaying the visual icons of apps like Instagram, Facebook, and some extras like a browser and a video game mixed with the surroundings inside a small office at Meta's headquarters.Boorstin saw those digital icons overlaid atop her real-world surroundings with her own eyes. That's an improvement over \"passthrough\" techniques used by current VR devices. For passthrough, companies use cameras on the outside of their headsets to show users a digital representation of the real world blended with computer graphics through their device screens.Orion is able to overlay digital imagery on the real world using a much more expensive method. Its lenses aren't made from traditional glass or plastic but rather a refractive material called silicon carbide. When the Orion's miniaturized projectors, built in to the arms of the glasses, beam light into the silicon carbide lenses, users can see \"holograms\" in their field of vision, an experience Boorstin said \"felt totally normal and very natural.\" When the holograms were turned off, \"it felt as if you were wearing glasses or sunglasses, and it wasn't distracting or nauseating,\" Boorstin said.Boorstin was able to open, close and scroll through the apps with the help of a wristband, that she said felt similar to an old, lightweight Fitbit.\"The wristband can sense your finger and hand movements, so your hand can be by your side,\" Boorstin said, describing how her finger movements and gestures manipulated the digital icons. \"I was surprised that it was so accurate and that I could figure out these hand motions, and it picked them up exactly.\"In one demo, the Orion glasses were able to identify various food ingredients, like chia seeds, that were spread out on a table. It then projected a suitable recipe that appeared digitally above the real-world seeds. In another demo, Boorstin played a simple game of pong, except the video game graphics were projected onto a real-world desk in front of her.One demo that really impressed her involved seeing the face of Stephen Desaulniers, her producer, digitally appear in front of her while he called from another room. The overall experience of the 3D video call \"felt very clear\" to Boorstin, who noticed that the graphic's resolution would change depending on where she placed it within her field of vision. It was enough to startle her into questioning whether or not the producer could actually see her in real life since it appeared as if he was there in front of her (he could not).\"I could see him perfectly, and he could not see me,\" Boorstin said. \"But I could hear him, and it was like I was FaceTiming with him, but he was in my glasses.\"By experiencing Orion, Boorstin said she has a better sense of how Meta's research and development is directly benefiting the company's other products, like its Quest headsets and Ray-Ban smart glasses.\"They've been working so hard to make these components teeny, tiny, efficient, weightless,\" she said.

The e-commerce giant's shares in Hong Kong are around 18% higher this week. Tencent, the owner of China's biggest messaging app WeChat and one of the largest gaming firms in the world, closed up nearly 2% at 437.80 Hong Kong dollars per share. This is the firm's highest close in more than two-and-a-half years and comes after Tencent's stock rallied around 49 % this year amid a recovery in its core gaming business.Food delivery giant Meituan meanwhile ended the session 8% higher at 164.60 Hong Kong dollars a share, the company's highest close level since February last year.The market uptick comes after the People's Bank of China this week announced a cut to the amount of cash that banks need to have on hand. The central bank outlined plans to further\u00a0support the struggling property market, including extending measures for two years and cutting the interest rates on existing mortgages.These measures have been declared in the hope of boosting the Chinese economy. Prior to the cuts, investors had been cautious on Chinese tech stocks like Alibaba and Meituan which are sensitive to the economy and consumer in China.However, big-name investor have started to strike a bullish tone on Chinese stocks. Billionaire hedge fund founder David Tepper told CNBC on Thursday that, after the U.S. Federal Reserve cut interest rates this month, he bought more Chinese stocks including names like Alibaba and Baidu.Other names including JD.com and Baidu also logged share increases this week.Despite the latest upswing, Chinese tech stocks remain significantly off their all-time highs hit in 2021.- CNBC's Evelyn Cheng contributed to this report.

Later that day, Sam Altman said two top research executives, Bob McGrew and Barret Zoph, were also leaving.\"I wanted to personally reach out following the news of Mira's departure from OpenAI,\" Friar wrote. \"While leadership changes are never easy, I want to ensure you have the full context.\"Friar added that, \"We are incredibly proud of everything she's helped build,\" and said the San Francisco-based company still has a \"talented leadership bench\" to compete.OpenAI, which is backed by Microsoft and recently partnered with Apple on its AI for iPhones, is in the midst of closing a $6.5 billion funding round, which should value the company at roughly $150 billion, according to sources familiar with the matter. Thrive Capital is leading the round, and plans to invest $1 billion, according to the sources.Friar said in the email that the funding round was oversubscribed and would close by next week. She said the team plans to host a series of calls with investors to introduce the group to key leaders from product and research teams.\"Collectively, we remain laser-focused on bringing AI to everyone and building sustainable revenue models that fuel our operations and deliver value to our investors and employees,\" Friar wrote. The company is \"excited for you to be with us as we enter our next chapter,\" she wrote.OpenAI declined to comment on the email.Murati's departure comes after 6\u00bd years at the company. She briefly served as interim CEO last year after the board of directors abruptly fired Altman. When Altman was quickly reinstated, Murati returned to the role of CTO. The company was already dealing with the loss of key executives. Co-founder John Schulman and safety chief Jan Leike left to join rival Anthropic. Co-founder Ilya Sutskever departed to start another AI company, while another founder, Greg Brockman, is on a leave of absence.Friar said Mark Chen will step into the role of of senior vice president of research, and leaders like Kevin Weil, who joined from Meta, and Srinivas Narayanan are the \"right people to keep pushing the boundaries of innovation.\"Friar was formerly CEO of Nextdoor, and before that CFO at Block, formerly Square.Also on Thursday, at an all-hands meeting, Altman denied that there are plans for him to receive a \"giant equity stake\" in the company, calling reports of such a development \"just not true,\" according to a person who was in attendance.Altman and Friar both said at the meeting, conducted by video, that investors have raised concerns about Altman not having equity in the company that he co-founded almost nine years ago, said the person, who asked not to be named because the gathering was only for employees.

Should the change occur, the nonprofit segment would remain as a separate entity, said the person, who asked not to be named because no plan has been finalized.While directors consider OpenAI's future, key executives continue to walk out the door.On Wednesday, three execs announced their departures. OpenAI Chief Technology Officer Mira Murati, who briefly served as interim CEO, said she would be leaving after 6\u00bd years. Later in the day, research chief Bob McGrew and Barret Zoph, a research vice president, said they were leaving the company.In an interview Thursday at Italian Tech Week, Altman said, \"I think this will be hopefully a great transition for everyone involved and I hope OpenAI will be stronger for it, as we are for all of our transitions.\"Altman said the departures were not related to the company's potential restructuring, contrary to some media reports.\"Most of the stuff I saw was also just totally wrong,\" Altman said at the event in Turin, Italy. \"But we have been thinking about that, our board has, for almost a year independently, as we think about what it takes to get to our next stage. But I think this is just about people being ready for new chapters of their lives and a new generation of leadership.\"Murati wrote in a memo to the company that she's \"stepping away because I want to create the time and space to do my own exploration.\" She said her focus will be on ensuring a \"smooth transition.\"Before Thursday's moves, OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever and former safety leader Jan Leike\u00a0announced their departures\u00a0in May. Co-founder John Schulman said last month that he was leaving to join rival Anthropic.OpenAI, which is backed by\u00a0Microsoft, is currently pursuing a funding round that would value the company at more than $150 billion, people familiar with the matter told CNBC. Thrive Capital is\u00a0leading the round\u00a0and plans to invest $1 billion, and\u00a0Tiger Global\u00a0is planning to join as well.While OpenAI has been in hypergrowth mode since the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022, it's been simultaneously\u00a0riddled with controversy\u00a0and\u00a0executive departures, with some current and former employees concerned that the company is growing too quickly to operate safely.Altman was ousted in November, before being quickly reinstated. Almost all of OpenAI's employees signed an open letter saying they would leave in response to the board's action.

Konttori was formerly chief technology officer of Varjo, another Helsinki-based mixed-reality firm. Distance is primarily focused on selling into the auto, aerospace and defense markets. The way Distance works is by using tracking technology to identify where you are looking and then compute the correct light field to match the exact positions of your eyes, according to Konttori.Distance's solution adds a set of optics layers on top of most liquid crystal displays (LCDs), which allow its tech to beam an image onto the places where your eyes are focusing.Using this technique, Distance can separate the light fields into your left and right eyes, while also creating an additional optical layer underneath that creates a high brightness.Distance says its system is capable of \"infinite\" pixel depth, meaning it can create a life-size field of view in any setting \u2014 whether behind the wheel of a car or flying an F-18 fighter jet.GV, which was formerly known as Google Ventures and counts the internet search giant's holding company Alphabet as its sole limited partner, told CNBC that it was attracted to invest in Distance due to the \"potential to build the next-generation of user interfaces.\"\"We are particularly excited about how some of the nearer-term pathways to bring this to market in automotive and aerospace allow the potential for users to get their hands on this technology,\" Roni Hiranand, principal at GV, told CNBC.Commercializing mixed reality isn't an easy feat. For one, mixed-reality devices are still expensive. Apple's Vision Pro and Microsoft's HoloLens 2 devices both start at $3,500 \u2014 and they're not cheap to make, either. A new AR glasses concept device Meta unveiled Wednesday reportedly cost the firm $10,000 per unit to make, according to The Verge.Meta was not immediately available for comment when contacted by CNBC. Augmented reality heads-up displays, or HUDs, aren't a new phenomenon in the automotive industry. Companies have been working to add AR features to cars for several years, with tech giant Huawei among the early movers to pioneer the tech in China.A slew of other display technology firms are developing their own AR HUDs for cars, including First International Computer, Spectralics, Envisics, Futurus, CY Vision, Raythink, Denso, Bosch, Continental, and Panasonic.According to Distance Technologies Chief Marketing Officer Jussi M\u00e4kinen, the company's system can cover the entire surface of any transparent surface, not just a specific corner or the bottom half of a display \u2014 a limitation that most automotive AR HUDs are facing today.\"The main difference here is that we are driven by the software,\" M\u00e4kinen told CNBC.The company previously showcased a proof-of-concept version of its technology at the Augmented World Expo USA 2024 mixed-reality industry trade show in June.For now, Distance has had to use simple optics and normal LCD displays to demonstrate its technology to prospective partners and investors. Going forward, Konttori said he's getting ready to push a \"very expensive\" button: advancing Distance's optics technology into what he calls the next generation early next year.\"I would say that we have been in the research cycle now,\" Distance's CEO said. \"Now, we are switching into the product cycle. And the key thing to do is work with somebody who will become your customer \u2026 one or two to work very closely with, and then a finalized product specification.\" " }, { "page": "https://www.cnbc.com/technology/?page=2", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/26/just-eat-takeawaycom-to-deliver-sex-toys-in-partnership-with-lovehoney.html", "date": "Thu, Sep 26th 2024", "author": "Ryan Browne", "title": "Grubhub-owner Just Eat to deliver sex toys in partnership with Lovehoney", "content": "Grubhub-owner Just Eat Takeaway.com said Thursday it had partnered with sex toy retailer Lovehoney Group, in an unexpected expansion into the so-called sexual wellness sector.The Anglo-Dutch online takeaway delivery firm said it would sell some of Lovehoney's best-selling products, including sex toys from its popular Womanizer, We-Vibe- ROMP and Fifty Shades of Grey products lines.The offering will be available via the company's Just Eat brand in the U.K. and Denmark, and it's Liferando food ordering service in Austria.Shares of Just Eat Takeaway.com climbed 2% Thursday, above the pan-European Stoxx 600 index's 1% gains.

He's the director of elections in Durham County, North Carolina, one of the most-populous areas of a state that's increasingly viewed as crucial to the 2024 presidential contest.So when a former precinct official emailed Bowens in July to warn him of a post containing voting misinformation that was spreading virally on Facebook, Bowens quickly recognized that he may be facing a crisis.The post, written as if from an authority on the subject, said voters should request new ballots if a poll worker, or anyone else, writes anything on their form, because it would be invalidated. The same incorrect message was spread on Facebook during the 2020 election, but the platform flagged the content at the time as \"false information\" and linked to a story that debunked the rumor by Facebook's fact-checking partner, USA Today.Bowens said no such tag appeared on the post, which was widespread enough that the North Carolina State Board of Elections had to issue a press release on Aug. 2, informing voters that false \"posts have been circulating for years and have resurfaced recently in many N.C. counties.\"\"It was spreading and there wasn't anything happening to stop it until our state put out a press release and we started engaging with our constituency on it,\" Bowens told CNBC in an interview.The elections board wrote a post on Facebook, telling voters to \"steer clear of false and misleading information about elections,\" with a link to its website. As of Wednesday, the post had eight comments and 50 shares. Meanwhile, multiple Facebook users in states like North Carolina, Mississippi and New Jersey continue to share the ballot misinformation without any notification that it's false.CNBC flagged posts with the false information to Meta. A company spokesperson said, \"Meta has sent them to third-party fact-checkers for further review.\"Across the U.S., with 40 days until the Nov. 5 election, state and local officials say they are puzzled by what to expect from Facebook. Like in the past two presidential election cycles, the spread of misinformation on the social network has threatened to disrupt voting in what's expected to be another razor-thin contest decided by thousands of voters in a handful of states. Recently, a Facebook post containing a false claim about Haitian immigrants eating pets in Springfield, Ohio, ballooned out of control and gained resonance after it was repeated by Republican nominee Donald Trump in a debate.In 2016, Facebook was hammered by Russian operatives, pushing out false posts about Hillary Clinton to bolster Trump. In 2020, the site hosted rampant misinformation about politically charged issues like Covid treatments, masking and voter fraud.The big difference this go-round is that Facebook has largely removed itself from the equation. In 2021, Meta began pushing political and civic content lower in its algorithms, which contributed to a dramatic decline in news traffic last year for publishers. Earlier this year, Meta announced that it would deprioritize the recommendation of political content on Instagram and its Twitter-like Threads service, a move the company said more aligns with what consumers want to see on their feeds.Still, posts with false information can spread rapidly across wide swaths of users along with comments that amplify the misinformation, and government agencies have little ability to counteract them, because they have such limited reach on the platform. And while Facebook has lost some of its prominence due in part to the rise of TikTok, particularly among younger audiences, the site still had more than 200 million daily users in the U.S. and Canada at the end of last year, the last time it issued regional numbers. Facebook and Instagram are generally both in the top 10 among the most-visited websites and most-popular apps in the U.S, according to the Pew Research Center and Similarweb.Interviews with nearly a dozen regional and statewide government officials with election-related duties reveal the challenges they say they're having using and monitoring Meta's apps, as well as other social networking services like X, now owned by Elon Musk. The officials say they're working overtime to ensure the safety and integrity of the election but say they're receiving little effective help from the companies, which scaled back their trust and safety teams as part of broader cost-cutting efforts that began in 2022.Meta ultimately cut 21,000 jobs, including in trust and safety and customer service, over multiple rounds of layoffs. As CNBC reported last year, the company dissolved a fact-checking tool that would have let news services like The Associated Press and Reuters, as well as credible experts, add comments at the top of questionable articles as a way to verify their trustworthiness. Reuters is still listed as a fact-checking partner, but an AP spokesperson said the news agency's \"fact-checking agreement with Meta ended back in January.\"\u00a0The Meta spokesperson told CNBC in a statement that the company's \"integrity efforts continue to lead the industry and we have around 40,000 people globally working on safety and security \u2014 more than we had during the 2020 cycle.\" The company says it now partners with about 100 third-party fact-checking groups across the globe \"who review and rate viral misinformation in more than 60 languages.\" Like North Carolina, Arizona is one of the seven swing states expected to determine whether Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, win the presidency.That reality has put Taylor Kinnerup in the spotlight. Kinnerup is the communications director for the recorder's office of Maricopa County, home to more than half of Arizona's population.Kinnerup and her colleagues use social media to distribute up-to-date information about election-related procedures, like when residents can mail in early ballots or where to find their voting center. It's a particularly sensitive job following Trump's false claims of voter fraud in Arizona in 2020, when the state went blue for the first time in a presidential contest since 1996.Given Maricopa County's high profile during the election season, the state often attracts attention from Facebook users across the country. Many of them, Kinnerup said, are older and still leave comments about debunked conspiracy theories, such as the false claim that Sharpie markers invalidate ballots.Kinnerup said her team places \"extreme emphasis on constant communication and transparency to the public,\" actively sharing election-related content across Facebook and Instagram, particularly during peak hours when it's more likely to reach voters.A few months ago, Kinnerup discovered that her office's Facebook and Instagram accounts were no longer linked, meaning she couldn't access the apps using the same credentials, or automatically schedule a single post to go across both sites.Ahead of the primary elections in July, Kinnerup said she struggled to resolve the account issues with Meta. She said she engaged in a monthslong email exchange with numerous representatives, but found there was \"no way to really make progress.\" When she did get a response, it was little more than a canned statement, Kinnerup said.Meanwhile, Kinnerup is busy overseeing media and constituent tours of the county's election facilities to help dispel false notions that the process is being rigged as her office continues to deal with the fallout of the 2020 election. Kinnerup said her team led more than 20 such tours in June.\"I couldn't be dealing with Meta every single day, because I had to be giving tours,\" Kinnerup said. The time spent trying to find a fix \"was a huge issue for me,\" she said.By the time Kinnerup said she'd resolved her account issues, in mid-July, she and her colleagues had wasted countless hours on the problem, leaving her team to \"feel we were put in a position where the full message we were trying to get out wasn't ever fully there.\"Even with her office's Facebook and Instagram accounts working again, Kinnerup says their organic social media posts generate little engagement, and her team has used sponsored ads to help expand reach across the platforms. Her team has continued with the facility tours, leading 25 this month.Meta's spokesperson said the company has been hosting training sessions for state and local officials since February, informing them of tools like voting alerts, which allow them to send messages to people in their area. \"There are multiple channels by which officials can reach us, including teams responsible for specific states and regions, and our ability to respond to them remains unchanged,\" the spokesperson said.Kinnerup said she was not \"aware of any of this,\" and in her year in the role has \"never received any direct communication with Meta that I'm aware of.\"Bowens told CNBC in a follow-up email that he \"was not aware of the sessions or the tools.\"Congress is well aware of potential problems. During a Senate hearing last week on election threats, Meta's head of global affairs, Nick Clegg, fielded questions about the company's election preparedness. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, expressed concern about the safety and integrity of \"down-ballot races at the state level, county level, local level.\"Intelligence agencies, Collins said, have told senators that bad actors from China could be focusing on disrupting regional races as opposed to the presidential election, and that state and regional officials \"are far less likely to receive the kinds of briefings that we receive or to get information from Homeland Security or the FBI on how to be on alert.\"Clegg said Collins was \"right to be concerned\" and that Meta's \"vigilance needs to be constant.\"\"It can't just sort of peak at the time of the presidential elections,\" Clegg said. For Scott McDonell, the Dane County clerk in the swing state of Wisconsin, it's been difficult to share accurate voting information on Facebook from his office's official government account, which only has 608 followers on Facebook. McDonell said his posts get very little traction compared with years past.\"If I link to a story about election security, three people will see it,\" McDonell said. Posts that include pictures do marginally better, he said, because \"Facebook likes pictures.\"\"Don't link to an article, that will go to zero,\" he said.McDonell said many of his colleagues have \"gotten abused\" so much on Facebook in recent years that they don't post about elections anymore.\"Basically, your average county clerk is terrified of it, and they just do it to share baby photos,\" McDonell said. In Los Angeles County, Jeramy Gray, the chief deputy of the registrar-recorder/county clerk office, said small government offices often lack the resources needed to effectively utilize social media and to troubleshoot problems.Meta \"recently put a team together to assist\" his office, Gray said, adding that the company appears to be the \"most mature\" of the big platforms even if it's not a \"model partner.\"\"What I would like to see is just more engagement from them, at least three to four months from a large national election, for them to reach out to key stakeholders at the state and local level to really talk about what they can do or what they're doing,\" Gray said.Bowens, in North Carolina's Durham County, said the tech platforms could be much more helpful in assisting his office and others as they navigate through some of the confusion about what type of content is acceptable.Bowens said he's concerned about acting too aggressively because of potential censorship issues and recognizes there's a gray area between misinformation and citizens exercising their First Amendment rights.\"You know, we've got a very diverse election system in this country,\" Bowens said. \"What was on that post may very well be true in another state. Therefore, is it misinformation?\"WATCH: Sizing up Trump and Harris' economic plans " }, { "page": "https://www.cnbc.com/technology/?page=2", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/26/major-global-chip-stocks-rally-on-strong-micron-forecast.html", "date": "Thu, Sep 26th 2024", "author": "Arjun Kharpal", "title": "Major global chip stocks rally on Micron's surge; ASML up 4%", "content": "Global chip stocks rallied on Thursday after U.S. memory semiconductor maker Micron posted revenue guidance that topped expectations and boosted its share price.Micron forecast revenue for its quarter ending at the end of November of $8.7 billion, plus or minus $200 million, ahead of estimates of $8.28 billion, according to LSEG data.Shares of Micron closed up 15% in the U.S. on Thursday.

Klarna's deal with Adyen comes as the Swedish tech giant is exploring a much-anticipated initial public offering.Klarna hasn't yet set a fixed timeline on when it expects to go public, however the firm's CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski told CNBC earlier this year that a 2024 IPO for the business wouldn't be \"impossible.\"In August, Klarna began rolling out a checking account-like product, called Klarna balance, as well as cashback rewards in a bid to convince consumers to move more of their financial lives over to its platform.BNPL has faced criticisms from consumer rights campaigners, however, over fears it promotes the idea of consumers spending more than they can afford. Regulators are pushing for rules to bring the nascent \u2014 but fast-growing \u2014 payment method into regulation.The recently elected U.K. Labour government is expected to set out plans for buy now, pay later regulation soon.City Minister Tulip Siddiq said in July that the government would establish new proposals \"shortly\" after multiples delays to the previous Conservative government's regulation plans for BNPL.

The complaint was filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.American Eagle said it didn't authorize Amazon to sell products from its Aerie line of yoga pants, lingerie, loungewear and other attire, adding that it \"intentionally declined so Aerie can foster its own brand identity and customer experience.\" American Eagle, founded in 1977, launched the Aerie brand in 2006.A shopper searching for Aerie products on Google will see sponsored and organic links to Amazon's website, the lawsuit says. Clicking on a link leads to an Amazon webpage that \"displays only knock-offs and 'dupes'\" of Aerie products, including sweatshirts and exercise shorts, American Eagle alleges. The company said it notified Amazon \"over a month ago\" of the infringing products, but says they were relabeled with misspellings of its Aerie trademarks, including \"Aeries,\" \"Arie\" or \"Aries.\"\"These ads are intended to (and do) trick customers into thinking that by clicking the provided link, they will be able to 'Shop Aerie' or 'Save on Offline by Aerie' on the 'Official Amazon Site,'\" the complaint states. \"These statements are patently false because customers cannot shop for Aerie products on Amazon.\"Many of the alleged Aerie knock-offs referenced in the lawsuit are sold by third-party sellers on Amazon's online marketplace. Launched in 2000, the marketplace allows businesses to hawk their goods on the company's site. It's amassed millions of sellers, and accounts for more than half of all goods sold on the site.Amazon has faced similar complaints for years. In 2016, shoemaker Birkenstock announced it would pull its products from Amazon in response to a surge in counterfeits. That year, German automaker Daimler AG sued Amazon after it discovered knock-off versions of Mercedes-Benz wheels sold by a third-party seller.In 2019, Amazon added a line to the \"risk factors\" section of its annual financial filing warning investors of the growing threat of third-party sellers peddling counterfeits. Since then, the company has stepped up its efforts to police counterfeits on its site, launching a team that pursues criminal action against counterfeiters, filing lawsuits and rolling out tools to help brands protect their trademarks.Amazon representatives didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. The company has previously said it prohibits the sale of counterfeits on its site.American Eagle is seeking an injunction and financial damages based on Amazon's alleged trademark infringement.WATCH: How the U.S. government and Amazon are fighting Chinese counterfeits " }, { "page": "https://www.cnbc.com/technology/?page=2", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/25/amazon-automation-scammers-sued-by-ftc-for-false-claims-death-threats.html", "date": "Thu, Sep 26th 2024", "author": "Annie Palmer", "title": "Promises of 'passive income' on Amazon led to death threats for negative review", "content": "Jamaal Sanford received a disturbing email in May of last year. The message, whose sender claimed to be part of a \"Russian shadow team,\" contained Sanford's home address, social security number and his daughter's college. It came with a very specific threat.The sender said Sanford, who lives in Springfield, Missouri, would only only be safe if he removed a negative online review.\"Do not play tough guy,\" the email said. \"You have nothing to gain by keeping the reviews and EVERYTHING to lose by not cooperating.\"Months earlier, Sanford had left a scathing review for an e-commerce \"automation\" company called Ascend Ecom on the rating site Trustpilot. Ascend's purported business was the launching and managing of Amazon storefronts on behalf of clients, who would pay money for the service and the promise of earning thousands of dollars in \"passive income.\"Sanford had invested $35,000 in such a scheme. He never recouped the money and is now in debt, according to a Federal Trade Commission lawsuit unsealed on Friday.His experience is a key piece of the FTC's suit, which accuses Ascend of breaking federal laws by making false claims related to earnings and business performance, and threatening or penalizing customers for posting honest reviews, among other violations. The FTC is seeking monetary relief for Ascend customers and to prevent Ascend from doing business permanently.It's the latest sign of the FTC's crackdown on e-commerce money-making schemes on top of some of the internet's leading marketplaces, like Amazon and Airbnb. Since mid-2023, the agency has sued at least four automation companies, alleging deceptive marketing practices and falsely telling customers that they could generate passive income.The FTC isn't just focused on e-commerce automation businesses. On Wednesday, the agency said it's stepping up enforcement against companies that use artificial intelligence \"as a way to supercharge deceptive or unfair conduct that harms consumers.\" The agency pointed to Ascend as a company that it took action against in part because of its claims that it used AI \"to maximize clients' business success.\"The FTC has also pledged to go after companies that try to suppress negative reviews online as part of new rules issued this year targeting fake reviews.Automation businesses like Ascend promote their easy money opportunities on Instagram, TikTok and YouTube. But their promises go mostly unfulfilled, and often the storefronts get shut down for violating policies around dropshipping \u2014 the selling of products to customers without ever stocking inventory \u2014 or counterfeits.The FTC's complaint against Ascend accused co-founders Will Basta and Jeremy Leung of defrauding consumers of at least $25 million through their scheme. Formed in 2021, Ascend has done business under several entity names with operations registered in states including Texas, Wyoming and California. The filing shows that the threats against Sanford grew more menacing. Two days after the initial email, Sanford's wife's phone lit up with a text message containing an image of a severed head that again urged the removal of the unflattering review.\"Your husband has angered some people with his ignorance,\" the text message said. \"The type he does not wish to anger.\"Sanford soon purchased a security system for his home.Sanford said in an interview that Ascend had promised his Amazon storefront would generate enough revenue to cover the cost of inventory the company bought each month on his behalf. Months went by and his store amassed a \"smorgasbord\" of items, from LED lights to vitamins, which Ascend purchased from other retailers like Macy's and Home Depot and then sold on Amazon, Sanford said. The company used the dropshipping model, Sanford said, which often led to the stores getting suspended on Amazon.Amazon prohibits merchants from dropshipping unless they identify themselves as the seller of record, meaning their name is listed on the invoice, packing slip and other materials. As Sanford's sales sputtered and his debts swelled, he made a series of complaints to Basta and Leung. When they went unanswered, he left the negative reviews. Sanford said Ascend eventually offered to refund him $20,000 if he would take down the review, but he declined.\"I think I'm resigned to the fact that I won't be getting my money back and now I just want accountability,\" he said.Karl Kronenberger, a lawyer for Ascend, said in a statement that the company denies ever threatening customers and it attempted to resolve any disputes \"in good faith.\"\"We are investigating whether a competitor of Ascend may be the driving force behind some of the allegations in the case,\" Kronenberger said.Ascend's marketing pitch claimed customers could quickly earn thousands of dollars from sales generated on Amazon, Walmart and other platforms. The company said it had developed proprietary artificial intelligence tools that it used to identify top-selling products.E-commerce automation companies are increasingly exploiting Amazon's third-party marketplace, which now hosts millions of merchants and accounts for more than half of all goods sold on the site.Amazon didn't provide a comment for this story.Ascend promoted the scheme as \"risk free,\" the FTC said, because of its buyback guarantee, which effectively committed to make clients whole if they didn't recoup their investment within 36 months.\"After consumers invest, the promised gains never materialize, and consumers are left with depleted bank accounts and hefty credit card bills,\" the regulator wrote in its complaint.To add an air of legitimacy, Ascend falsely claimed it had been featured in media outlets like Forbes, Yahoo! Finance and Business Insider, the FTC said. It primarily advertised its business on social media platforms TikTok, X, YouTube and Instagram.Ascend faces two lawsuits in California that allege breach of contract and other claims, according to the FTC. In January, an arbitration action was filed against Ascend in Florida on behalf of 30 customers. Nima Tahmassebi, an attorney representing the Ascend customers, told CNBC that the clients chose to withdraw the claim once they learned of the FTC case.Tahmassebi said he has been contacted by more than 100 individuals who \"all but begged for legal assistance\" because they lost money after paying for Ascend's automation services.\"I'm talking to people who said I can't get Christmas gifts this year because of my situation with them,\" Tahmassebi said. \"People took money they could have applied to their kid's college tuition. Now it's gone, and they're left bewildered.\"WATCH: How Amazon became 2023's top apparel and footwear seller " }, { "page": "https://www.cnbc.com/technology/?page=2", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/25/openai-cto-mira-murati-announces-shes-leaving-the-company.html", "date": "Wed, Sep 25th 2024", "author": "Hayden Field", "title": "OpenAI considering restructuring to for-profit, CTO Mira Murati and two top research execs depart", "content": "OpenAI's board is considering plans to restructure the firm to a for-profit business, according to a source who asked to remain anonymous because the talks are ongoing. The company will retain its non-profit segment as a separate entity, the source said.The structure would be more straightforward for investors and would make it easier for OpenAI employees to realize liquidity, the source added.News of the discussions comes after OpenAI Chief Technology Officer Mira Murati said Wednesday that she is leaving the company after six and a half years.Later in the day, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said research chief Bob McGrew and Barret Zoph, a research vice president, are also departing, as the high-valued artificial intelligence startup continues to lose top talent.Murati wrote in a memo to the company that she's \"stepping away because I want to create the time and space to do my own exploration.\" She said her focus will be on ensuring a \"smooth transition.\"\"After much reflection, I have made the difficult decision to leave OpenAI,\" she wrote in the memo, which she also published on social media site X. \"There's never an ideal time to step away from a place one cherishes, yet this moment feels right.\"Altman wrote in a late afternoon post on X that McGrew and Zoph were leaving, and that their decisions were independent of each other.\"The timing of Mira's decision was such that it made sense to now do this all at once, so that we can work together for a smooth handover to the next generation of leadership,\" Altman wrote.They're the latest high-level executive to depart OpenAI, which has exploded in popularity and value since releasing the ChatGPT chatbot in late 2022. OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever and former safety leader Jan Leike announced their departures in May. Co-founder John Schulman said last month that he was leaving to join rival Anthropic. OpenAI, which is backed by Microsoft, is currently pursuing a funding round that would value the company at more than $150 billion, according to sources familiar with the situation who asked not to be named because details of the round have not been made public. Thrive Capital is\u00a0leading the round and plans to invest $1 billion, and\u00a0Tiger Global is planning to join as well.Microsoft,\u00a0Nvidia\u00a0and\u00a0Apple\u00a0are reportedly also in talks to invest. While OpenAI has been in hyper-growth mode since late 2022, it's been simultaneously\u00a0riddled with controversy\u00a0and executive departures, with some current and former employees concerned that the company is growing too quickly to operate safely.Murati became a well-known name when OpenAI's board abruptly ousted Altman last November and Murati was named interim CEO.OpenAI's board said in a statement at the time that Altman had not been \"consistently candid in his communications with the board.\" The Wall Street Journal\u00a0and other media outlets reported that Sutskever trained his focus on ensuring that AI would not harm humans, while others, including Altman, were instead more eager to push ahead with delivering new technology.Almost all of OpenAI's employees had signed an open letter saying they would leave in response to the board's action. Days later, Altman was back at the company and Murati moved back to her former role as CTO. Board members Helen Toner and Tasha McCauley were out. Sutskever was removed from the board but remained an employee at the time.Murati raised eyebrows in June, telling an audience at The Wall Street Journal's WSJ Tech Live conference that new artificial intelligence tools will likely lead to the disappearance of some creative jobs.\"Some creative jobs maybe will go away, but maybe they shouldn't have been there in the first place if the content that comes out of it is not very high quality,\" Murati said in an on-stage interview, adding, \"I really believe that using it as a tool for education [and] creativity will expand our intelligence and creativity and imagination.\"McGrew wrote in a departing post on Wednesday that, since joining \"the small non-profit\" in January 2017, OpenAI has \"become the most important research and deployment company in the world.\" He said he's taking a break, and that Mark Chen will lead the research team.In a post on X, Zoph called it a \"natural point for me to explore new opportunities outside of OpenAI.\" He added that the \"post-training team has many talented leaders and is being left in good hands.\" " }, { "page": "https://www.cnbc.com/technology/?page=2", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/25/meta-unveils-cheaper-299-quest-3s-vr-headset-.html", "date": "Wed, Sep 25th 2024", "author": "Kif Leswing", "title": "Meta unveils $299 Quest 3S VR headset, Orion AR glasses prototype", "content": "Meta announced the Quest 3S, the latest virtual reality headset to come out of the company's Reality Labs division and a cheaper offering than its predecessor.The device will go on sale on Oct. 15, and it'll retail starting at $299, down from the $499 starting price for 2023's Quest 3. The device can be used to watch movies, as well as run VR fitness apps and gaming, Meta said Wednesday at its Connect event in Menlo Park, California. The company positioned the headset as a multitasking computer, putting it in competition with Apple's $3,499 Vision Pro headset that launched in February.In addition to the Quest 3S, Meta on Wednesday also showcased its latest prototype of augmented-reality smart glasses and announced a flurry of new features for its Meta AI chatbot.Meta's previous Quest devices are the bestselling VR headsets, with millions shipped thanks to heavy marketing and a lower price than many competitors, but those efforts have yet to spark a cultural phenomenon or a mainstream software ecosystem around VR. Including its acquisition of Oculus in 2014, Meta has poured more than $65 billion in expenses into its hardware efforts.Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has defended the company's spending as a strategic initiative to prevent Apple from controlling future hardware platforms.Although there was hope among VR developers that Apple's entry into the market would spur a wave of new apps and users, Apple hasn't revealed sales for its headset and reports suggest that sales have been in small volumes, under 1 million units, partially due to its high price. A Meta representative said the \"S\" in Quest 3S stands for \"start\" \u2014 as in getting started with VR.Many of the new Meta features that the company discussed for the $299 Quest 3S have counterparts on Apple's Vision Pro, including a mode that allows for the device to be used on an airplane and another that simulates a large movie theater inside the headset.Meta highlighted improved \"passthrough,\" the term used to described when a VR headset uses cameras and sensors on the outside of the device to display live real-time video inside the headset. That function is intended to make users feel like they are looking through a display and allows them to interact with the real world while keeping the headset on. For the Quest 3S, Meta added a dedicated button to turn on passthrough.The company has emphasized the ability of the Quest 3S to multitask and run apps, positioning it as a computing device, instead of a game console.\"All the things you can do with a general purpose computer, Quest is the full package,\" Zuckerberg said.In demos provided Tuesday, Meta showcased the device running as many as four apps at one time on floating screens inside the headset, including a YouTube video, a browser, Amazon Music and Meta's app store. Meta says the headset can handle six windows. But the demo experience was not smooth. The Amazon Music app crashed, window controls would disappear and Meta's controllers would fall asleep after a few minutes if the user wasn't pressing buttons.Besides the Quest 3S, Meta also announced a price cut for last's year Quest 3, bringing the price of the 512GB version down from $649 to $499. The Quest 3 has more advanced lenses and a superior screen with a higher resolution than the Quest 3S.Additionally, Meta said it will discontinue the Quest Pro, its $999 headset launched in 2022 that never gained much momentum, and the older Quest 2 headset. Zuckerberg's justification for spending so much on VR and AR is his belief that the technology will eventually end up in lightweight, transparent glasses that overlay computer graphics and information onto the real world.Investing in VR software and hardware are early steps toward those glasses, which could take as much as a decade to develop, Zuckerberg previously said.Zuckerberg showed off an early concept of what those glasses could look like on Wednesday. The thick, black-framed prototype, called Orion, won't be sold to consumers, but Meta says they will be used internally as the company continues working toward the consumer glasses it hopes to one day sell.\"This is where we are going,\" Zuckerberg said.Meta hopes the next version of Orion will be available to consumers as the company's first full AR glasses, Zuckerberg said without giving a timetable for when that may be.Orion is Meta's first \"fully-functioning\" prototype AR glasses, Zuckerberg said, and the device is tethered wirelessly to a small \"puck.\" The prototype uses a wristband component to pick up on users neural signals and let them control the Orion glasses using their brains. That technology stems from the company's 2019\u00a0acquisition of CTRL-Labs.Orion enables users to play games, multi-task with multiple windows and videoconference with people around the world represented by a realistic avatar, Zuckerberg said.Meta's Orion prototype comes a week after Snap announced its fifth-generation Spectacles AR glasses. Those thick-framed glasses will only be made available to developers, who must commit to paying $99 a month for one full year if they want to build AR apps for the device.This isn't the first time Meta publicly revealed a prototype of a future devices or research projects to signal to investors and employees where VR and AR technology is headed. The Orion glasses are an improvement on Project Nazare, prototype smart glasses that Zuckerberg announced in 2021, when the company changed its name from Facebook. Meta does sell a pair of glasses with a built-in camera in partnership with EssilorLuxottica called Ray-Ban Meta, which start at $299 and were announced in 2023. While these glasses don't have any displays, they do have tiny speakers that allow the device to play music or interact with Meta AI, the company's voice assistant.As part of Wednesday's event, Meta announced new Meta AI features for its Ray-Ban smart glasses.For example, the Ray-Ban Meta glasses will be able to detect when a user is looking at a sign in Spanish and, if asked, can translate in the user's ear, a new improvement, Meta said. The camera can scan QR codes, and it can also extract information like book titles out of photos it takes.Another new capability for the glasses is the ability to remember facts like where the user parked.\u00a0Li-Chen Miller, the vice president of product in charge of Ray-Ban Meta glasses, told CNBC that when she travels, she uses the glasses to take photos of her hotel room door, and later, she asks Meta AI to recall the number.\u00a0Those features will become available \"later this year,\" the company said.The Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses have sold more than 730,000 units in their first three quarters, according to market researcher IDC. In July, Zuckerberg told investors that they were \"a bigger hit sooner than expected.\"Last week, EssilorLuxottica and Meta announced that they had extended their partnership to develop more smart glasses. Zuckerberg also introduced improvements to its Meta AI chatbot that will allow people to interact with it using their voice in addition to written prompts.With voice, users will be able to have oral conversations with Meta AI, which is accessed through Meta's apps. Users will be able to perform actions using their voice, such as telling Meta AI to take a photo by talking to their smartphone.For Meta AI's new feature, the company is using computer-generated voices from celebrities including Awkwafina, Judi Dench, John Cena, Keegan-Michael Key and Kristen Bell.The new Siri-like Meta AI voice feature will be available over the next month for U.S., Canadian, Australian and New Zealand users of WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook and Messenger.The Meta AI announcement comes a day after rival OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, announced an advanced voice feature for people who pay for its premium service.Meta's new chatbot features are based on the company's AI model, Llama. Meta on Wednesday announced a newer version of Llama, called Llama 3.2. This updated model can understand both images and text, an upgrade from its predecessors which generated responses to people's written prompts.WATCH: Meta chatbot to use celebrity voices " }, { "page": "https://www.cnbc.com/technology/?page=2", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/25/how-apple-and-microsofts-trusted-brands-are-being-used-to-scam-you.html", "date": "Wed, Sep 25th 2024", "author": "Cheryl Winokur Munk", "title": "How Apple and Microsoft\u2019s trusted brands are being used to scam you online", "content": "No, it's not really Apple or Microsoft popping up on your screen to tell you your computer has been infected.It's scammers trying to convince you to call them and divulge sensitive information, which may include passwords, bank or credit account information or Social Security numbers.\"They use the reputation of the brand [for legitimacy purposes] to make it seem more real,\" said Cliff Steinhauer, director of information security and engagement at The National Cybersecurity Alliance. \"Because, who doesn't know Microsoft or Apple as a brand?\"Consumers are likely to see more of these types of scams now, in the wake of Apple's recent release of its new iPhone. There tends to be a rise in scams when a new product or version is released because it's easier for scammers taking advantage of news headlines to strike while the iron is hot, said Nati Tal, head of Guardio Labs, which identifies, monitors and mitigates internet security threats. \"In a very small time period, they will get tons and tons of potential victims.\"The scams can affect anyone, but as has been the case with other recent tech-linked consumer crime waves, such as bitcoin ATM fraud, the elderly are especially vulnerable. Last year, nearly 18,000 victims aged 60 and over reported tech support scams to the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center, making it the most widely reported kind of elder fraud in 2023.\u00a0Fraud losses from tech support scams against the elderly amounted to $590 million of losses \u2014 and that's only reported cases.These types of scams are getting even harder to spot because of AI, especially when the scheme uses a known company logo to make it look legit. Here's what people should know to protect themselves from scams targeting commonly used, trusted tech brands:Never assume any online ad is authenticPeople can be duped in a number of ways. One way is malvertising, in which bad actors pay for ads on search engines like Google or Microsoft's Bing. These rogue ads can appear as sponsored content, or in small print as an ad, during a search engine query.So, for example, a consumer searching for \"Microsoft support\" might be shown a fake Microsoft ad with a number to call. By calling this number, people are playing right into scammers' hands, according to Malwarebytes, which has identified a number of these schemes. Malwarebytes also uncovered a malicious ad campaign targeting Mac users looking for support or extended warranty from Apple.\"People have all sorts of issues with their computers and they look for help, but a lot of the time the numbers they find will be a scammer's number, not the real one,\" said J\u00e9r\u00f4me Segura, senior director of research at Malwarebytes.Pop-ups, emails from brands you know are often suspectTech scams also ensnare unsuspecting consumers through phishing emails for renewal offers that seem to come from legit places, including Microsoft, McAfee, PayPal and Norton. These emails could be laced with malware if users click on a link, or they could be phishing attempts to get more information from the individual. Sometimes simply opening the attachment could infect a consumer's computer with malware.\u00a0The other type of tech-support scam happens when a window pops up on a user's computer to warn of an \"infection.\"There's often audio associated with this type of scam to instill a sense of urgency for consumers to call the number listed in the pop-up. There may also be a button that says \"return to safety,\" but when clicked, what was a regular browser window \u2014 with the address bar and window title visible \u2014 becomes a full-screen page, with a message about not rebooting the computer because it's infected, Segura said.\"Imagine being the user and hearing the non-stop audio playing in the background saying your computer is compromised. This is very stressful and it will lead people to make a bad decision in calling the fake phone number,\" he said.Once people call, they often are manipulated into sharing personal information such as their credit card number or giving scammers access to their computer.How to click without getting into online troubleFor starters, consumers should avoid clicking on sponsored ads obtained during a Google or Bing query. (Hint: These often appear at the top of the search results page, but they can also appear further down, so look out for the word \"sponsored\" or \"ad\" depending on the search engine.) Consumers should also avoid clicking on random links sent in an email, even if they think they know the sender. And don't open attachments unless you're sure you know what's being sent.In the case of a pop-up warning of a computer virus, Segura said the general rule is to only click on the browser's own icons which are typically at the very top right corner. \"Never click on any other 'X' within the web page itself, as it is fake,\" he said.\u00a0If people do click on the X or have clicked on \"return to safety,\" the webpage will likely go into full-screen mode. \"If that happens, you must first exit out of full screen by long pressing on the keyboard's escape button (Esc) and only then can you finally X out,\" Segura said.\u00a0Internet browsers come with basic protections, so be sure to keep your browsers updated. You might also want to install a free, or paid-protection service that covers multiple types of threats.\u00a0What to do if you fall for a tech scamNext steps depend on the type of information you shared with scammers. If, for instance, you called a number for \"Microsoft\" or \"Apple\" and gave usernames and passwords, change those. If you only shared your name, address and phone number, it's not necessary to do anything because this information is readily available to scammers through data brokers, Jim Routh, chief trust officer at identity security company\u00a0Saviynt, explained in an email.\u00a0Consumers who share their credit card number, expiration date and CVV, should call their credit card company's fraud line to report the incident and request a new credit card be overnighted.If credentials are shared with the fraudster for other online accounts, the password for each should be immediately changed. It's also advisable for consumers to freeze their credit with each of the three primary credit bureaus, Equifax,\u00a0Experian and TransUnion. This is a good practice to do for your whole family and especially for children under 18, even in the absence of a particular threat. It's also advisable to place a fraud alert with one of the credit bureaus, which will relay the information to all three.People who are concerned they installed malware who don't have anti-virus protection should choose a reputable brand and install it, Routh said. If they lack technical sophistication, they can call the Geek Squad or a similar service to scan the workstation and find the malware to remove. Consumers who have given remote computer access to scammers should bring their device to a service professional for assistance, he added.

These GPUs which are housed in data centers are critical for the training of huge AI models which underpin applications like OpenAI's ChatGPT. Meanwhile, companies like Qualcomm are designing chips that go into smartphones and personal computers and allow those devices to run AI applications locally rather than via an internet connection in the cloud. These are often referred to as AI-enabled devices and companies from Samsung to Microsoft have released such products.Bain said demand for GPUs and AI consumer electronics could be the cause of a chip shortage.\"Surging demand for graphics processing units (GPUs) has caused shortages in specific elements of the semiconductor value chain,\" Anne Hoecker, head of the technology practice in the Americas at Bain, told CNBC by email.\"If we combine the growth in demand for GPUs alongside a wave of AI-enabled devices, which could accelerate PC product refresh cycles, there could be more widespread constraints on semiconductor supply.\"However, it's unclear at this point how much demand such AI-enabled gadgets will have, given what appears to be a cautious approach to them from consumers so far.Bain noted that the semiconductor supply chain is \"incredibly complex, and a demand increase of about 20% or more has a high likelihood of upsetting the equilibrium and causing a chip shortage.\"\"The AI explosion across the confluence of the large end markets could easily surpass that threshold, creating vulnerable chokepoints throughout the supply chain,\" the report added. The semiconductor supply chain is spread across multiple companies. For example, while Nvidia might design its GPUs, they are made by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., or TSMC, in Taiwan. TSMC relies on chipmaking tools from countries around the world, such as the Netherlands. Furthermore, the most cutting-edge chips can only be made at a large scale by TSMC and Samsung Electronics.Geopolitics could also be a factor prompting a chip shortage. Semiconductors are seen by governments around the world as strategic technology. The U.S. has been on a campaign, via export restrictions and other sanctions, of trying to restrict China's access to the most advanced chips. Meanwhile, Washington has sought to shore up its own domestic capacity to produce semiconductors.\"Geopolitical tensions, trade restrictions, and multinational tech companies' decoupling of their supply chains from China continue to pose serious risks to semiconductor supply. Delays in factory construction, materials shortages, and other unpredictable factors could also create pinch points,\" Bain said.

Amazon Web Services, which is a CISPE member, and Alibaba's cloud unit AliCloud, also chose not to become part of the settlement.For its part, Microsoft has denied that its cloud practices harm competition. In response to a cloud market study initiated by the U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority, the firm said that it \"firmly believes that the cloud services market is functioning well.\"Correction: A U.K. Competition and Markets Authority study determined Microsoft\u00a0acquired 60% to 70% of all new British cloud customers in 2021 and 2022.

The tool allows for more fluid conversations.The release will continue through the week. The company said it's not yet available in EU countries, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Switzerland or the U.K.OpenAI announced the new capability in May. The rollout got plenty of publicity because of a voice called Sky that resembled that of Scarlett Johansson in the 2013 movie \"Her.\" Legal counsel working on behalf of Johansson sent OpenAI letters claiming the company didn't have the right to use the near-identical voice, and OpenAI paused using it in its products, CNBC reported.In the months since, people have been able to configure ChatGPT to talk to them in other voices through a free tier. The advanced version responds more quickly and will stop talking and listen if you interrupt it. There are now nine voices to choose from, and you can enter instructions for voice chats in the Customizations part of the app's settings.\"Hope you think it was worth the wait,\" Sam Altman, OpenAI's co-founder and CEO, wrote in an X post on Tuesday.It's an increasingly competitive space for OpenAI, which is backed by Microsoft.For the past couple weeks, Google has been releasing its own Gemini Live voice feature in English on Android devices. And on Monday, Reuters reported that Meta will introduce celebrity voices later this week that can be accessed through Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp.OpenAI got a head start in the generative AI chatbot market, when it launched ChatGPT in late 2022. In August, OpenAI told media outlets that ChatGPT had over 200 million weekly active users.The advanced mode is only available to those with subscriptions to OpenAI's Plus, Team or Enterprise plans. The most affordable option is the Plus tier at $20 per month. If you're paying, it's easy to get started, assuming OpenAI has granted access to your device.First, make sure you have the latest version of the app on your phone.Open the ChatGPT app.OpenAI says you'll receive a notification in the app once it's turned on access to the new feature. Hit the continue button to get started.Create a new chat by swiping right or tapping the two-line icon in the top left corner and selecting ChatGPT at the top. To the right of the \"Message\" text field and the microphone icon, you should see a sound wave icon. Tap that and make sure your sound is on. In a few seconds, you'll hear a little \"bump\" sound, and the circle in the middle of the screen will morph into a fluid sky-like blue and white animation. Start speaking. You should receive a response quickly. Don't be surprised if audio breaks up a bit.OpenAI said it has improved accents in some foreign languages and has increased the speed of conversations. But if you don't like what you're hearing, you can ask ChatGPT to speak differently. You can tell it to speed up, for example, or incorporate a Southern accent.With advanced voice mode, you can have ChatGPT tell you a bedtime story, help you get ready for a job interview or even work on your foreign language skills.But even if you're paying, you won't have unlimited access to advanced voice mode. After using it for about a half hour on Tuesday, I started seeing \"15 minutes left\" at the bottom of the screen.The Plus and Team subscription tiers for ChatGPT have a daily rate limit for advanced voice mode, after which you can use the standard version, a spokesperson said.Plus, you can't transition from a text conversation with ChatGPT to advanced voice mode, nor can you take a standard voice conversation into the advanced mode, according to a help page on OpenAI website.

Defense lawyers also had requested a no-prison sentence for Ellison.Alameda received much of the $8 billion in customer funds looted by Bankman-Fried from FTX. The stolen money was used for Alameda's trading operation and other purposes. While Kaplan praised Ellison, 29, for her extensive cooperation with prosecutors \u2014 which led to the conviction of Bankman-Fried \u2014 the judge said her criminal sentence needed to deter other potential bad actors from committing fraud.The judge said the FTX case is probably the greatest financial fraud perpetrated in the history of the U.S., and because of that a \"literal get-out-of-jail-free card I can't agree to,\" Kaplan said in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, where Ellison's parents and two sisters looked on from the courtroom's gallery.\"I've seen a lot of cooperators over the years and I've never seen one quite like Miss Ellison,\" said Kaplan, who also said he believed that Ellison was genuinely remorseful for her crimes and that her cooperation carried a steep price for her emotionally.Assistant U.S. Attorney Danielle Sassoon urged Kaplan for leniency, citing Ellison's consistent truthfulness while refusing to minimize her role in the fraud. Sassoon also said she could not overstate Ellison's assistance in convicting Bankman-Fried.Ellison's attorney, Anjan Sahni, urged the judge to give Ellison a second chance saying she has \"recovered her moral compass\" and \"profoundly regrets\" not leaving FTX and Bankman-Fried's orbit. Ellison read from a statement in a shaky voice while crying at times as she apologized to the people she had hurt and said she was deeply ashamed. She also said she was sorry for not being brave enough to walk away from FTX and Bankman-Fried.Kaplan allowed Ellison to remain free on bail until she surrenders to prison either on or after Nov. 7.Ellison reached a plea deal with prosecutors in December 2022, a month after FTX spiraled into bankruptcy.\u00a0She pleaded guilty\u00a0to conspiracy and financial fraud charges.Bankman-Fried, in contrast, chose to stand trial and was\u00a0convicted of all seven\u00a0criminal fraud charges against him. He was sentenced to 25 years in prison in March and also was ordered to pay $11 billion in forfeiture by Kaplan.Bankman-Fried since then has appealed his conviction, and requested a new trial and a different judge, arguing that Kaplan was biased against him.Two other former FTX executives, Gary Wang and Nishad Singh, are scheduled to be sentenced later this year. Like Ellison, they pleaded guilty instead of standing trial.On Tuesday, before sentencing Ellison, Kaplan noted that while the FTX founder had denied criminal conduct, she cooperated with authorities. \"It didn't work out so well\" for Bankman-Fried, in part because of Ellison's cooperation, the judge said.Kaplan credited Ellison for providing prosecutors with seven fake spreadsheets, which he called \"one of the huge pieces of evidence in the case\" against Bankman-Fried.Late Monday, Ellison's attorneys in a court filing said they had finalized financial settlements with prosecutors and the FTX debtor's estate.The filing did not say how much she would pay in those settlements, which are separate from the forfeiture order, but it was already known that Ellison's $10 million in shares in the artificial intelligence startup Anthropic, which have grown substantially since she first bought them, provide the bulk value of her settlements.Both Bankman-Fried and Ellison had faced the same statutory maximum sentence of about 110 years in prison for their crimes.Defendants in criminal cases who cooperate with prosecutors instead of fighting the charges, particularly in white-collar cases such as FTX, often receive leniency when they are sentenced.

Companies using its enterprise-focused tools tend to store closed-source \u2014 rather than open-source \u2014 software projects on the platform. GitHub is primarily known as a destination for individual coders and teams to create and store open-source code. However, the firm has been increasingly pushing a business-to-business sales model, especially after its takeover by Microsoft in 2018.For businesses storing closed-source projects, the ability to control where that sensitive programming is stored and controlled, as well as the level of access granted to users, is paramount \u2014 especially in the EU, according to GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke.\"Europe is the place where cutting-edge regulation and laws around privacy and data protection and many other things, like AI, were born,\" Dohmke told CNBC on a video call.\u00a0\"Here there are exciting frameworks to transfer data back and forth around the world.\"\"Data residency emerged as an important driver for any enterprise's cloud strategy, and enterprises want to know where crucial assets like data is being stored,\" he added.Shelley McKinley, GitHub's chief legal officer, said that closed-source code is today considered the \"crown jewels\" of a company's digital strategy.\"European customers were demanding more from us in this area,\" she told CNBC. \"The EU has been in the center of this [data residency] movement since the beginning of the cloud days.\"Going forward, GitHub plans to roll out data residency within its GitHub Enterprise Cloud across other regions, including Australia, Asia, and Latin America. GitHub's data residency push ties into a broader political and regulatory theme within the EU around so-called digital \"sovereignty.\"The EU is investing billions into what it believes are fundamental and core technologies to boost its tech sovereignty and reduce dependency on the U.S. and China. The region is currently heavily reliant on technologies that come from beyond its borders. Top officials are in the process of trying to change this.Earlier this month, a long-awaited report from former European Central Bank President Mario Draghi called for 800 billion euros of additional investment per year to make the bloc more competitive, citing technology innovation as a key area where improvement is needed.\"Europe must profoundly refocus its collective efforts on closing the innovation gap with the US and China, especially in advanced technologies. Europe is stuck in a static industrial structure with few new companies rising up to disrupt existing industries or develop new growth engines,\" Draghi said in the report.GitHub's Dohmke said that Europe is currently lagging behind the U.S. and China when it comes to adoption of cloud computing. According to figures from data center operator Stackscale, 45% of EU enterprises used cloud computing last year, up about 4 percentage points from 2021 to 2023. But it is particularly low in certain countries.For example, in France, only 27% of enterprises in the EU use cloud technology, whereas in Nordic countries adoption rates are much higher, with 78% of enterprises using the cloud in Finland.From a global perspective, though, Dohmke said he is optimistic about the future of tech advancements. In November last year, GitHub launched a new version of its \"Copilot\" programming assistant, called GitHub Copilot Enterprise, to give developers inside companies a way to more easily generate software code using AI technology.According to Dohmke, developers using its Copilot assistant have been able to generate code 55% faster than programmers not using the AI software.In the future, he envisages a world where AI automates an even greater share of the workload involved in writing code.Developers will start to get \"AI-native agents\" to fulfil certain tasks in their coding journeys, he said, adding that it'll also become easier for people who aren't software programmers to be able to create their own software code thanks to artificial intelligence.

On Tuesday, she will face her own sentencing.Ellison's role in the implosion of the crypto empire run by her former boss and ex-boyfriend Sam Bankman-Fried was to lie to investors, help steal billions of dollars from FTX customers, and subsequently repurpose those funds toward bets and debts accrued at Alameda Research, the digital asset hedge fund she helmed as CEO.Bankman-Fried and Ellison are both, in the eyes of the U.S. judicial system, guilty of the same crimes.Two counts of wire fraud, two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud, one count of conspiracy to commit commodities fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering. Those charges carry a statutory maximum sentence of around 110 years, but there's a sliding scale that takes into account the scope of the crimes and the criminal history of the defendant.CNBC spoke to former federal prosecutors, trial attorneys and legal experts to get their take on what may be in store for Ellison at Tuesday's hearing. They agree that Ellison is likely to walk away without any jail time at all.After a jury of 12 unanimously found Bankman-Fried guilty of all seven criminal charges against him in November, he was sentenced in March to 25 years for his crypto fraud and ordered to pay $11 billion in forfeiture.Unlike Bankman-Fried, Ellison agreed to a plea deal in December 2022. She pleaded guilty\u00a0to all charges against her and spent two years cooperating with the government, regulators and the FTX bankruptcy estate.Meanwhile, Bankman-Fried continues to deny virtually all criminal wrongdoing and is attempting to get his case retried.Lawyers for Ellison and Bankman-Fried did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Cooperation with the prosecution in white-collar crimes, even in what has been billed as \"one of the biggest financial frauds in American history,\" goes a long way.Ellison was the most important of the several insiders who testified for the government, said former Assistant U.S. Attorney Kevin J. O'Brien, who specializes in white-collar criminal defense in New York.\"Because of the closeness of her relationship to Sam, she was able to provide a personal portrait of Bankman-Fried, an elusive character to be sure, that was probably unique in the government's case,\" O'Brien said.The federal Probation Department has recommended \"time served with three years of supervised release\" as a credit to Ellison's \"extraordinary cooperation with the government\" and \"her otherwise unblemished record.\"While District Judge Lewis Kaplan is under no obligation to accept the Probation Department's recommendation, O'Brien said that, along with some sort of fine, that would be \"a fair sentence\" because it reflects the \"enormous value\" of Ellison's cooperation.The U.S. legal system tends to favor reduced sentences for those who assist in bringing down higher targets, said Braden Perry, a former senior trial lawyer for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.At most, Perry estimates that Ellison, who is the third executive tied to Bankman-Fried's enterprise to be sentenced, faces 18 months in prison and three years of supervised release.Though Ellison was deeply involved in the fraudulent activities, \"she did not have the same control or directorial authority as SBF, which will likely influence the judge's decision about imposing a light sentence,\" Perry said. More than likely, Ellison's conviction will entail several years of supervised release and community service with a slew of attached activity restrictions, such as no trading in both crypto and noncrypto markets or foreign travel, said Yesha Yadav, law professor and associate dean at Vanderbilt University.Unlike Bankman-Fried who has faced public admonition and been portrayed by the government as a recidivist character, Ellison has been praised repeatedly by prosecutors and by new FTX CEO and bankruptcy administrator John Ray III.\"On the stand, she came across as someone who felt guilt and pain at what she had done,\" Yadav said.SBF's defense team asked for no more than 6\u00bd years of incarceration, but Kaplan said Ellison's testimony ultimately proved pivotal to his decision to sentence Bankman-Fried to nearly four times that.Kaplan also sided with federal prosecutors when he revoked Bankman-Fried's bail and\u00a0sent him back to jail\u00a0for witness tampering after he leaked private diary entries written by Ellison. Kaplan described the leak by Bankman-Fried as one designed to \"hurt\" and \"discredit\" Ellison.Ellison \"suffered very public humiliation over the last two years, often with sexist overtones,\" Yadav said.Most judges don't like sending people to jail who aren't a threat to harm others in the future, said former federal prosecutor Paul Tuchmann.\"The chance of Ellison ever harming anyone through criminal conduct in the future again are very low,\" Tuchmann said.If Kaplan ends up forgoing jail time in Ellison's sentence, that could bode well for former FTX engineering chief Nishad Singh and Gary Wang, the co-founder and chief technology officer of FTX. Singh and Wang will be sentenced Oct. 30 and Nov. 20, respectively.\"I do think that if he wants to, Judge Kaplan can 'afford' to give all of these people no prison time,\" said Tuchmann. \"Most judges want to encourage people like that to cooperate, and a sentence of time served and probation is the best way to do that.\" WATCH: Sam Bankman-Fried's family on sentencing: We are heartbroken and will continue to fight for our son " }, { "page": "https://www.cnbc.com/technology/?page=2", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/22/middle-eastern-funds-plowing-billions-into-the-hottest-ai-start-ups-.html", "date": "Sun, Sep 22nd 2024", "author": "Kate Rooney", "title": "Middle Eastern funds are plowing billions into the hottest AI start-ups ", "content": "Sovereign wealth funds out of the Middle East are emerging as key backers of Silicon Valley's artificial intelligence darlings.Oil-rich nations like Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Qatar have been looking to diversify their economies, and are turning to tech investments as a hedge.

MGX was\u00a0launched\u00a0as a dedicated AI fund in March, with Abu Dhabi's Mubadala and AI firm G42 as founding partners.UAE's Mubadala has also invested in OpenAI rival Anthropic, and is among the most active venture investors, with eight AI deals in the past four years, according to Pitchbook. Anthropic ruled out taking money from the Saudis in its last funding round, citing national security, sources told CNBC.\u00a0Saudi Arabia's PIF is in talks to create a $40 billion partnership with U.S. venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz.

French sovereign fund Bpifrance has inked 161 AI and machine learning deals in the past four years, while Temasek out of Singapore has completed 47, according to Pitchbook. GIC, another Singapore-backed fund, has completed 24 deals.The flood of cash has some Silicon Valley investors worried about a SoftBank effect, referring to Masayoshi Son's Vision Fund. SoftBank notably backed Uber and WeWork, pushing the companies to sky-high, valuations before going public. WeWork spiraled into bankruptcy last year after being valued by SoftBank at $47 billion in 2019. For the U.S., having sovereign wealth funds invest in American companies, and not in global adversaries like China, has been a geopolitical priority.

Intel said in August that it's cutting 15,000 jobs, or more than 15% of its workforce.But Gelsinger is still calling the shots and, for now, he says Intel is pushing forward as an independent company with no plans to spin off the foundry. In a memo to employees on Monday, he said the two halves are \"better together,\" though the company is setting up a separate internal unit for the foundry, with its own board of directors and governance structure and the potential to raise outside capital. For the company that put the silicon in Silicon Valley, the road to revival isn't getting any smoother. By forging ahead as one company, Intel has to two clear two gigantic hurdles at once: Spend more than $100 billion through 2029 to build chip factories in four different states, while simultaneously gaining a foothold in the AI boom that's defining the future of technology.Intel expects to spend roughly $25 billion this year and $21.5 billion next year on its foundries in hopes that becoming a domestic manufacturer will convince U.S. chipmakers to onshore their production rather than relying on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and Samsung.That prospect would be more palatable to Wall Street if Intel's core business was at the top of its game. But while Intel still makes the majority of processors at the heart of PCs, laptops, and servers, it's losing market share to Advanced Micro Devices and reporting revenue declines that threaten its cash flow. With challenges mounting, the board met last weekend to discuss the company's strategy.Monday's announcement on the new governance structure for the foundry business served as an opening salvo meant to convince investor that serious changes are underway as the company prepares to launch its manufacturing process, called 18A, next year. Intel said it has seven products in development and that it landed a giant customer, announcing that Amazon would use its foundry to produce a networking chip.\"It was very important to say we're moving to the next phase of this foundry journey,\" Gelsinger told CNBC's Jon Fortt in an interview. \"As we move to this next phase, it's much more about building efficiency into that and making sure that we have good shareholder return for those significant investments.\"Still, Gelsinger's foundry bet will take years to pay off. Intel said in the memo that it didn't expect meaningful sales from external customers until 2027. And the company will also pause its fabrication efforts in Poland and Germany \"by approximately two years based on anticipated market demand,\" while pulling back on its plans for its Malaysian factory.\u00a0TSMC is the giant in the chip fab world, manufacturing for companies including Nvidia, Apple and Qualcomm. Its technology allows fabless companies \u2014 those that outsource manufacturing \u2014 to make more powerful and efficient chips than what's currently possible at volume inside Intel's factories. Even Intel uses TSMC for some of its high-end PC processors.Intel hasn't announced a significant traditional American semiconductor customer for its foundry, but Gelsinger said to stay tuned.\"Some customers are reluctant to give their names because of the competitive dynamics,\" Gelsinger told Fortt. \"But we've seen a large uptick in the amount of customer pipeline activity we have underway.\"Prior to the Amazon announcement, Microsoft said earlier this year it would use Intel Foundry to produce custom chips for its cloud services, an agreement that could be worth $15 billion to Intel. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in February that it would use Intel to produce a chip, but didn't provide details. Intel has also signed up MediaTek, which primarily makes lower-end chips for mobile phones. Intel's biggest champion at the moment is the U.S. government, whish is pushing hard to secure U.S.-based chip supply and limit the country's reliance on Taiwan.Intel said this week that it received $3 billion to build chips for the military and intelligence agencies in a specialized facility called a \"secure enclave.\" The program is classified, so Intel didn't share specifics. Gelsinger also recently met with Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, who is loudly promoting Intel's future role in chip production.Earlier this year, Intel was\u00a0awarded\u00a0up to $8.5 billion in CHIPS Act funding from the Biden administration and could receive an additional $11 billion in loans from the legislation, which was passed in 2022. None of the funds have been distributed yet.\u00a0\"At the end of the day, I think what policymakers want is for there to be a thriving American semiconductor industry in America,\" said Anthony Rapa, a partner at law firm Blank Rome who focuses on international trade.For now, Intel's biggest foundry customer is itself. The company started reporting the division's finances this year. For the latest quarter, which ended in June, it had an operating loss of $2.8 billion on revenue of $4.3 billion. Only $77 million in revenue came from external customers.Intel has a goal of $15 billion in external foundry revenue by 2030.While this week's announcement was viewed by some analysts as the first step to a sale or spinoff, Gelsinger said that it was partially intended to help win new customers that may be concerned about their intellectual property leaking out of the foundry and into Intel's other business.\"Intel believes that this will provide external foundry customers/suppliers with clearer separation,\" JPMorgan Chase analysts, who have the equivalent of a sell rating on the stock, wrote in a report. \"We believe this could ultimately lead to a spin out of the business over the next few years.\"No matter what happens on that side of the house, Intel has to find a fix for its main business of Core PC chips and Xeon server chips.Intel's client computing group \u2014 the PC chip division \u2014 reported about a 25% drop in revenue from its peak in 2020 to last year. The data center division is down 40% over that stretch. Server chip volume decreased 37% in 2023, while the cost to produce a server product rose.Intel has added AI bits to its processors as part of a push for new PC sales. But it still lacks a strong AI chip competitor to Nvidia's GPUs, which are dominating the data center market. The Futurum Group's Daniel Newman estimates that Intel's Gaudi 3 AI accelerator only contributed about $500 million to the company's sales over the last year, compared with Nvidia's $47.5 billion in data center sales in its latest fiscal year.Newman is asking the same question as many Intel investors about where the company goes from here.\"If you pull these two things apart, you go, 'Well, what are they best at anymore? Do they have the best process? Do they have the best design?'\" he said. \"I think part of what made them strong was that they did it all.\"\u2014 CNBC's Rohan Goswami contributed to this reportWATCH: CNBC's full interview with Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger " }, { "page": "https://www.cnbc.com/technology/?page=2", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/21/elon-musk-hopes-supercomputers-will-boost-tesla-and-xai.html", "date": "Sat, Sep 21st 2024", "author": "Magdalena Petrova", "title": "How Elon Musk hopes his new supercomputers will boost his businesses ", "content": "Elon Musk is on a mission to build new supercomputers. As the CEO of Tesla and his new artificial intelligence startup xAI, the tech titan has big plans for how artificial intelligence can help to supercharge his businesses.In January, he wrote on X that Tesla should be viewed as an AI/robotics company rather than a car company. Tesla's custom-built supercomputer named Dojo is key to this transformation. Tesla has said it plans to spend $500 million to build the supercomputer in Buffalo, New York. Tesla is also building another supercomputer cluster, called Cortex, at the company's headquarters in Austin, Texas.Dojo will process and train AI models using the large amounts of video and data captured by Tesla cars. The goal is to improve Tesla's suite of driver assistance features, which the company calls Autopilot, and its more robust Full Self-Driving or FSD system. Subscriptions to Tesla's FSD features cost $99 a month and include automatic lane changes, automatic parking and automatic stopping for traffic lights and stop signs.\"They've sold what is it, 5 million plus cars. Each one of those cars typically has eight cameras plus in it. And if you think then that those cars are driving around, let's just say 10,000 miles a year on average, they're streaming all of that video back to Tesla,\" says Steven Dickens, chief technology advisor at the Futurum Group. \"So what can they do with that training set? Obviously they can develop Full Self-Driving and they're getting close to that.\"Despite their names, neither Autopilot nor FSD make Tesla vehicles autonomous and require active driver supervision, as Tesla states on its website. In the past, the company has garnered scrutiny from regulators who say that Tesla falsely advertised the capabilities of its Autopilot and FSD systems. But reaching full autonomy is critical for Tesla, whose sky-high valuation is largely dependent on bringing robotaxis to market, some analysts\u00a0say.The company reported lackluster results in its latest earnings report and has fallen behind other automakers working on autonomous vehicle technology. These include Alphabet-owned Waymo, which is already commercially operating fully autonomous taxis in several U.S. cities, GM's Cruise and Amazon's Zoox. In China, competitors include Didi and Baidu.Tesla hopes Dojo, which Musk says has been running tasks for Tesla since 2023, will change that. A Tesla robotaxi event originally scheduled for August is now expected to occur in early October.Dojo can also be useful for training Tesla's humanoid robot, Optimus, which the company plans to use in its factories starting next year. Musk has said that Tesla plans to spend $10 billion this year on AI.Musk is also betting on supercomputers to run his new AI venture xAI. Musk launched xAI in 2023 to develop large language models and AI products, like its chatbot Grok, as an alternative to AI tools created by OpenAI, Microsoft and Google.Despite being one of its founders, Elon Musk left OpenAI in 2018 and has since become one of the company's harshest critics.\u00a0In June, it was announced that xAI would build a supercomputer in Memphis, Tennessee to train Grok.\u00a0In early September, Musk revealed that a portion of the Memphis supercomputer, called Colossus, was already online.To learn more about Elon Musk's supercomputer plans, watch the video.

Musk's cancellation cost the SEC time and money after it sent personnel to Los Angeles to depose him and he didn't appear for the investigative interview, the agency said.Musk's deposition in the probe has been rescheduled for a date in early October at an SEC office, the filing said.\"Without further action by the Court, nothing deters Musk\" from \"simply failing to show up for that date,\" Andrews wrote.Musk's attorney, Alex Spiro, a partner at Quinn Emanuel in New York, wrote in a response that \"such drastic action would be inappropriate,\" adding that the SEC and Musk had agreed rescheduling would be permissible in light of an emergency.Additionally, Musk and his companies have \"cooperated and are cooperating with the SEC in multiple other ongoing investigations,\" Spiro wrote.In a separate, civil lawsuit concerning the same Twitter deal, the Oklahoma Firefighters Pension and Retirement System has sued Musk in a federal court in New York accusing him of deliberately concealing his progressive investments in Twitter and intent to buy out the company.The pension fund's attorneys argue that Musk, by failing to clearly disclose his investments in and intentions to buy Twitter, had influenced other shareholders' decisions and put them at a disadvantage.Discovery from that case in New York yielded correspondence between an unnamed person at Morgan Stanley, and the executive who manages Musk's money, Jared Birchall. In the messages, the Morgan Stanley contact wrote in February 2022 that Musk's Twitter stock-buying strategy was closely held.\"No one knows what is going on and why but you and me,\"  the person at Morgan Stanley wrote. \"Not compliance, not anyone.\"Read the court filing below: WATCH: Elon Musk's X is a financial 'disaster,' co-authors of new book 'Character Limit' say " }, { "page": "https://www.cnbc.com/technology/?page=2", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/20/qualcomm-reportedly-approached-intel-about-takeover.html", "date": "Fri, Sep 20th 2024", "author": "Rohan Goswami", "title": "Qualcomm recently approached Intel about a possible takeover", "content": "Qualcomm recently approached struggling chipmaker Intel about a takeover, CNBC has confirmed.It wasn't clear if Intel had engaged in conversations with Qualcomm or what the terms would be, according to a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be named because the information was confidential.The Wall Street Journal was first to report on the matter. Intel shares initially popped on the news before closing up about 3%, while Qualcomm shares fell about 3% at the close.\u00a0The deal, if it were to happen, would be one of the largest technology mergers ever. Intel has a market cap of over $90 billion.Once the world's largest chipmaker, Intel has for years been in a downward spiral that accelerated in 2024. The stock had its biggest one-day drop in over 50 years in August after the company reported disappointing earnings. Intel shares are down 53% this year as investors express doubts about the company's costly plans to manufacture and design chips.Qualcomm and Intel compete in several markets, including for PC and laptop chips. However, Qualcomm, unlike Intel, doesn't manufacture its own chips, and instead relies on firms such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and Samsung to handle production.On Monday, after a board meeting to discuss strategy, Intel CEO Patrick Gelsinger sent a memo to staff that reiterated the company's commitment to investing heavily in its foundry business, a project that could cost $100 billion over the next five years. It also said that it was weighing outside investment.Intel has also missed out on the artificial intelligence boom that's captured the attention of Wall Street. Most of the advanced AI programs, such as ChatGPT, run on Nvidia graphics processors, instead of Intel central processors. Nvidia has more than 80% of the fast-growing market, according to analysts.Qualcomm generates less revenue than Intel. It reported $35.8 billion in sales in fiscal 2023, compared with Intel's $54.2 billion during the same period.A potential deal would be complicated by antitrust and national security matters. Both Intel and Qualcomm do business in China, and both have seen deals scuttled by Chinese antitrust enforcers. Intel was unsuccessful with its attempted acquisition of Tower Semiconductor, as was Qualcomm in its bid to acquire NXP Semiconductor.Other giant acquisitions in the space have also been scuttled. In 2017, Broadcom made a bid to buy Qualcomm for more than $100 billion. The Trump administration blocked the deal the following year on national security concerns, because Broadcom was based in Singapore at the time. And in 2021, the Federal Trade Commission sued to block Nvidia's attempted purchase of Arm on antitrust grounds. The deal was called off in 2022 following additional pressure from regulators in Europe and Asia.Representatives for Qualcomm and Intel declined to comment.

The company lit up the glass cube at its Fifth Avenue Apple Store in New York City, in a nod to the enhanced Siri, which will light up the borders of the new iPhone's screen when that feature rolls out next month.Apple's fresh iPhones mark the company's latest move into artificial intelligence, with new Apple Intelligence features that will begin to launch in October. The new features will allow customers to rewrite text, remove objects from photos and speak with an improved Siri. The software advancements will only be available on iPhone 16 and last year's iPhone 15 Pro devices. But Apple shares slid on Monday after analyst reports suggested that demand for the latest iPhones was lower than expected. TF Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said in a note on Monday that first-weekend sales were down about 12% year over year from the iPhone 15 last year. Barclays, JPMorgan and Bank of America also noted shipping times could translate to lighter demand for the more expensive iPhone Pro models compared with last year.CNBC's Steve Kovach spoke with CEO Tim Cook outside Apple's Fifth Avenue store and asked whether sales looked better or worse than last year. \"I don't know yet. It's only the first hour, so we'll see,\" Cook said.On Friday, UBS analysts suggested investors shouldn't overreact to what appears to be lighter sales because that data is also collected by analyzing the wait times for new iPhone models and that those were longer last year due in part to supply chain disruptions. \"Ahead of the iPhone 16 announcement, our analysis suggested that a lack of a killer app and arguably somewhat half-baked introduction of Apple Intelligence would dampen demand,\" the UBS analysts wrote. \"While we still argue the collection of iPhone/iOS attributes are more evolutionary than revolutionary, we caution that investors not overreact to data that suggests somewhat initial tepid demand.\"The UBS analysts said supply chain disruptions last year \"slightly distorted/extended last year's data,\" which led to longer wait times for customers for Pro models. Last year, UBS wrote, customers had a 41-day wait time for some iPhone 15 Pro Max pre-orders compared with a 26-day wait time for the iPhone 16 Pro Max this year.\"Nevertheless, data across all models and regions roughly a week post launch support our view that a super-cycle is not imminent as US and China data on the margin is disappointing relative to last year,\" they wrote.

The company aims to differentiate itself by offering courses that on average cost less than $50, in order to be accessible to more kids in poorer parts of the country.\"We are not built for 1% of the country or 1% of the world, we are built for the remaining 99%, those who cannot go to these fancy coaching classes \u2026 now we enable different kinds of students,\" Alakh Pandey, CEO of Physics Wallah, told CNBC in an interview.The company runs on a freemium business model, hosting courses for free on YouTube. For those students who want more features such as homework and tests, there is a paid offering.The company said its revenue grew 250% year-on-year in the fiscal year ended March 2024 and Pandey said he expects the \"highest absolute\" EBITDA in the current fiscal year. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, or EBITDA, is one measure of profitability used by companies.Pandey said the company is open to acquisitions provided it gives them access to new content and users.\"Consolidation, we are open to it if it's based on different geography that we cannot serve to, and if it caters to content and community first,\" Pandey said.The CEO pointed to the equity investments it has already made. Last year, Physics Wallah brought a 50% stake in Xylem Learning, an ed-tech company headquartered in Kerala in south India. Pandey and his co-founder Prateek Maheshwari said that the company is focused on some key trends including the push for hybrid \u2014 both online and in physical classrooms \u2014 and broader internet penetration across villages, towns and smaller cities in India. All of this helps children from less-privileged backgrounds get access to education.The ed-tech boom in India began during the Covid pandemic when several companies looked to expand aggressively.But that expansion also led to some high-profile collapses in the sector, including ed-tech firm Byju \u2014 once valued at $22 billion \u2014 which has all but collapsed and is facing multiple insolvency proceedings in India. Its fall has been attributed to factors including aggressive acquisitions, high spend on marketing and mismanagement.Discussing some of the failures in the ed-tech sector in India, Pandey said his company is focused on the content it offers and the outcomes for students.\"If you see interviews or even read the headlines of previous actors that you're talking about, all they talk about is the crazy valuation they have, the funds they have raised how much money they have made,\" Pandey told CNBC.\"Education is different thing. It's not like any other startup that you can grow and talk about crazy valuation \u2026 at heart you have to accept that you are actually working to change the life of students.\"Maheshwari, who also spoke to CNBC, said that despite the failures, the market is still growing.\"I don't believe the market has shrunk. A couple of players have struggled to perform post-Covid \u2026 but the learners are increasing year-on-year,\" Maheshwari said.Speaking about Physics Wallah's future, Pandey said an initial public offering will happen, but wouldn't be drawn on a timeline.\"An IPO is something that we will do. We want to have a strong governance in the company, we are working on that, forming a board of independent directors \u2026 it's not that important for us when the IPO will happen, we are running the company like a public company,\" Pandey said.

The court said it would continue to impose \"joint liability\" on Starlink, the satellite internet service owned and operated by SpaceX, Musk's aerospace venture.The suspension of X in Brazil was initially ordered by the country's chief justice, Alexandre de Moraes, at the end of August, with orders upheld by a panel of justices in early September. The court found that under Musk, X had violated Brazilian law, which requires social media companies to employ a legal representative in the country and to remove hate speech and other content deemed harmful to democratic institutions. The court also found that X failed to suspend accounts allegedly engaged in doxxing federal officers.X recently moved to servers hosted by Cloudflare and appeared to be using dynamic internet protocol addresses that constantly change, enabling many users in Brazil to access the site. In a previous setup, the company had used static and specific IP addresses in Brazil, which were more easily blocked by internet service providers at the order of regulators.Musk, who owns X, formerly known as Twitter, has been lashing out at de Moraes for months and continued to do so after the order was issued. He's characterized de Moraes as a villain, comparing him to Darth Vader and Harry Potter character Voldemort. He has also repeatedly called for de Moraes to be impeached.Brazil previously withdrew money for fines it levied against X from the accounts of X and Starlink at financial institutions in the country. The new fines will begin as of Sept. 19, with the court calculating a total based on \"the number of days of non-compliance\" with its earlier orders to suspend X nationwide.While Musk presents himself as a free speech absolutist, X has acquiesced to requests to remove profiles and posts in countries including India, Turkey and Hungary.Musk and X may be in the process of complying with Brazil's takedown orders as well. Correio Braziliense, a Brazilian publication, reported on Wednesday that X has started blocking accounts as per suspension orders issued by the country's supreme court.Among the apparently banned accounts were those of some internet influencers who are reportedly being investigated for spreading misinformation and promoting attacks against democratic institutions in Brazil.\u00a0X said it wasn't intending to restore access for Brazilian users.\"When\u00a0X was shut down\u00a0in Brazil, our infrastructure to provide service to Latin America was no longer accessible to our team,\" a company spokesperson told CNBC on Wednesday. \"To continue providing optimal service to our users, we changed network\u00a0providers.

When Nio launched the Onvo brand in May, the company said the L60 would start selling at 219,900 yuan versus Tesla's Model Y at 249,900 yuan.Nio CEO William Li told CNBC in an exclusive interview Thursday that he hoped to launch Onvo in Europe as soon as next year, but he did not have a specific timeframe to share.He said the lower-priced brand would help the company better reach a global market, due to growing tariffs and other challenges for the premium Nio brand to reach its target overseas markets of Europe and the U.S.As for whether Onvo would cannibalize the Nio-branded sales, Li said the two brands are aimed at very different price segments. He noted how Nio's deliveries have improved since the company announced its plans for Onvo.China's electric car industry has become fiercely competitive over the last few years, with Nio and other companies vying for part of Tesla's market share.Geely-backed Zeekr is set to launch its first midsize electric SUV, the Zeekr 7X, in China on Sept. 20, starting at 239,900 yuan.Xpeng in late August announced its mass market brand Mona would begin sales of its M03 electric coupe in China. The basic version starts at 119,800 yuan, with a driving range of 515 kilometers (320 miles) and some parking assist features.A version of the Mona M03 with the more advanced \"Max\" driver assist features and a driving range of 580 kilometers will sell for 155,800 yuan. In comparison, Tesla's cheapest car \u2014 the Model 3 \u2014 costs 231,900 yuan in China, after a price cut in April.Chinese electric car companies have gradually expanded overseas, often starting with Europe. However, the European Union is nearing the end of a process that would increase tariffs on imported Chinese-made battery electric cars starting in early November. The bloc began an investigation into the Chinese EV makers' use of subsidies last year.Nio cooperated with the EU's probe but was not sampled, meaning its cars would be subject to a 20.8% duty, as of a July announcement from the European Commission. That's higher than the 19.9% tariffs slated for Geely cars, and 17.4% for BYD's. In the fourth quarter, Nio plans to start deliveries in the United Arab Emirates, Li told investors on an earnings call on Sept. 5.\"Because of the tariff in Europe now, selling or exporting cars from China to Europe becomes more expensive,\" Li said, according to a FactSet transcript.\"So we will focus on the existing five European markets that we have already started. We also know that to establish NIO such a premium brand in the European market will also take a longer time, and we are very patient with that.\" \"But in the meantime, it doesn't mean that we have stopped our activities there,\" Li said. \"Earlier this year, we have just opened our NIO house in Amsterdam, and we are still installing and deploying our power swap stations in Europe.\"He expects the L60 to reach 10,000 monthly deliveries in December, and 20,000 vehicle deliveries a month next year. He anticipates 15% vehicle margin on the new Onvo-branded cars.The brand aims to have more than 200 stores in China by the end of this year, and already opened more than 100 as of early September.Li said on the earnings call that Onvo and Firefly, an even lower-priced brand set to begin deliveries next year, would look to release vehicles for the international market.\u2014 CNBC's Sonia Heng contributed to this report.

Amazon describes it as an \"all-in-one, generative-AI based selling expert,\" and is making it accessible through Seller Central, the internal dashboard for third-party merchants.Amelia is the latest generative AI tool that Amazon has brought to market in the past year as it seeks to capitalize on the hype sparked by OpenAI's ChatGPT. The company has introduced an AI-powered shopping assistant named Rufus, a chatbot for businesses dubbed Q and Bedrock, a generative AI service for cloud customers.Amazon also plans to upgrade its Alexa voice assistant with generative AI features, CNBC previously reported, and the company has invested billions of dollars in OpenAI competitor Anthropic, its\u00a0largest venture deal to date.CEO Andy Jassy told investors earlier this year that the \"generative AI opportunity\" is almost unprecedented and that increased capital spending is necessary to take advantage of it.\"I don't know if any of us has seen a possibility like this in technology in a really long time, for sure since the cloud, perhaps since the internet,\" Jassy said on the company's first-quarter earnings call in April. Google and\u00a0Microsoft\u00a0have introduced rival products to try to ensure their relevance in a market that's predicted to\u00a0top $1 trillion\u00a0in revenue within a decade.AI has also become more prevalent across Amazon's e-commerce platform. The company now displays AI-generated summaries of product reviews and it's launched AI features for third-party sellers that can help them write listings and\u00a0generate photos for ads.Amazon also said Thursday it's launching tools that let sellers create AI-generated video ads and use AI to write product listings in bulk based on their entire catalog. The company said it's beginning to use generative AI to show personalized product recommendations and listings based on a user's shopping history. For instance, Amazon would show the term \"gluten free\" in the description for a box of cereal if a shopper typically searches for products with that phrase.Amazon made the announcements at its annual conference for sellers hosted in Seattle. Third-party sellers are the heartbeat of Amazon's dominant e-commerce business. Since about 2017, they've accounted for at least half of all goods sold on the site. In the second quarter of this year, that number swelled to 61%.Dharmesh Mehta, Amazon's vice president of worldwide selling partner services, told CNBC in an interview that a growing number of merchants are using its AI services. More than 400,000 of Amazon's millions of third-party sellers have used its AI listing tool, up from 200,000 in June, he said.With Amelia, Amazon is counting on generative AI to help with a key issue for third-party merchants \u2014 account troubleshooting. The company has sprawling teams that help sellers resolve account suspensions and deal with inventory issues, as well as build their business on the site. Merchants have long complained about the difficultly with getting swift resolution or reaching a human when unforeseen issues surface with their accounts. The company said Amelia can offer help investigating an account issue and, in the future, will be able to \"solve the problem on the seller's behalf.\" Mehta described how instead of filling out a form for missing inventory, a seller could ask Amelia to file a claim for them or the tool could resolve the issue automatically.\"There are going to be places where, hey, instead of chatting with seller support or getting on the phone with someone, maybe Amelia is able to do that and do that faster,\" Mehta said. \"I don't need to send an email to someone and wait for a response.\"Amazon said Amelia uses Bedrock, a software tool that lets users access large language models from Amazon and other companies like Anthropic and Stability AI. Mehta said Amelia is trained on public data from the web, along with information pulled from Amazon seller resources, FAQs and other public-facing websites.Mehta said the model isn't trained on seller-specific data, which is closely guarded.Amazon said the tool uses retrieval-augmented generation, or RAG, a popular AI industry framework that combines generative AI with long-established methods of information retrieval. It allows the pulling of certain seller-specific information from Amazon's internal systems without storing it or including it in model training data.

They have more advanced capabilities in math and coding, it added.The Hangzhou-headquartered firm is looking to increase competition with domestic rivals such as Baidu and Huawei, as well as U.S. titans like Microsoft and OpenAI. AI models are trained on huge amounts of data. Alibaba says its models have the ability to understand prompts and generate texts and images.Open-source means that anyone \u2014 including researchers, academics and companies \u2014 around the world can use the models to create their own generative AI apps without needing to train their own systems, saving time and expense.\u00a0By open sourcing the models, Alibaba hopes more users will use its AI.The Chinese e-commerce giant first launched its Tongyi Qianwen, or Qwen, model last year. Since then, it has released improved versions and says that, to date, its open source models have been downloaded 40 million times.The company also said that it upgraded its proprietary flagship model called Qwen-Max, which is not open-source. Instead, Alibaba sells its capabilities through its cloud computing products to businesses. Alibaba said that Qwen Max 2.5-Max surpassed rivals such as Meta's Llama and OpenAI's GPT4 in several areas including reasoning and language comprehension.Alibaba also launched a new text-to-video tool based on its AI models. This allows users to input a prompt and the AI will create a video based on it. This is similar to OpenAI's Sora.\"Alibaba Cloud is investing, with unprecedented intensity, in the research and development of AI technology and the building of its global infrastructure,\" Eddie Wu, CEO of Alibaba, said in a statement. Wu, who took over the role of CEO at Alibaba last year amid a historic reshuffle, has been trying to reinvigorate growth at the tech giant, as it faces headwinds including rising competition and a sluggish Chinese consumer.Alibaba is one of the biggest cloud computing players in China, but internationally, it trails the likes of Amazon and Microsoft. The company is hoping that its latest AI offerings may tempt customers inside and outside of China to sign up to its cloud services, boosting a division which has been sluggish but showed early sign of an acceleration in the June quarter.

Because nobody knows.\"Kavanaugh stressed that, overall, he's an optimist when it comes to AI's positive impacts and its ability to improve productivity.\"Sitting there and saying, 'I'm going to try to throw cold water on this fire, I'm going to try to put it out and ignore it,' that's a complete mistake.\"\"I believe in embracing [AI] and learning and being realistic about it. Because there will be jobs that will be disrupted, there's no question about that. But, for the most part, I truly believe it will be an enhancer and an accelerator of what we're all doing,\" Kavanaugh told CNBC.Kavanaugh co-founded WWT in 1990 with fellow St. Louis, Missouri-based entrepreneur David Steward as a reseller of technology equipment. Today, WWT is a tech giant in its own right, generating revenues of $20 billion annually.Kavanaugh currently has a net worth of $7 billion, according to real-time data from business news magazine Forbes. Prior to co-founding the company, Kavanaugh represented the U.S. national soccer team in the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. Fears about AI's disruptive effects on jobs aren't new. Some 300 million jobs could be automated away by generative artificial intelligence, according to a research paper published by Goldman Sachs last spring. The paper further noted that, in the U.S. and Europe, \"roughly two-thirds of current jobs are exposed to some degree of AI automation,\" while generative AI \"could substitute up to one-fourth of current work.\"Kavanaugh's not the only one who sees positive effects stemming from the use of AI in the world of work. Clara Shih, Salesforce's head of AI, told CNBC that there are jobs that will disappear due to the disruptive impact of the technology.Whether new technology will replace jobs is \"a question that's been asked throughout time,\" Shih said, referring to the creation of automation tools in factories, farming vehicles and machinery, and the internet as examples.\"There are a subset of jobs that are going to go away,\" Shih said. \"The internet destroyed a lot of jobs. But then it created brand new ones that we couldn't have even imagined in 1999.\"Ultimately, AI will be a positive force in the world of work, leading to new jobs, according to Shih. However, what our job descriptions look like might change.\"I think what we're seeing today with AI is that everyone needs a new job description,\" Shih said. \"Most jobs are not going to go away, but every job is going to require a new job description.\"Last week, as part of its annual Dreamforce event, Salesforce unveiled a new AI platform, called AgentForce. Companies can use the platform to build and customize their own AI \"agents,\" autonomous digital workers that can help with things like customer service and employee support.Some companies have even been actively touting the benefits of AI in reducing their overall personnel needs. For example, Swedish fintech firm Klarna said last month that it was able to slash its workforce from 5,000 to 3,800 in a single year thanks to AI, and then pay its remaining workers more.The \"buy now, pay later\" pioneer told the BBC it is looking to further reduce employee numbers next year, to 2,000 people, through the use of AI in areas like marketing and customer service.

These chips are enabling companies, such as ChatGPT maker OpenAI, to train their huge AI models on massive amounts of data.These AI models are fundamental to applications like chatbots and other emerging AI applications.The U.S. government has restricted the export of Nvidia's most advanced chips to China since 2022, with restrictions tightening last year. Such semiconductors are key to China's ambitions to become a leading AI player.CNBC spoke to analysts who identified some of China's leading contenders that are looking to challenge Nvidia, including technology giants Huawei, Alibaba and Baidu and startups such as Biren Technology and Enflame.The overarching view is that they are lagging behind Nvidia at this point.\"These companies have made notable progress in developing AI chips tailored to specific applications (ASICs),\" Wei Sun, a senior analyst at Counterpoint Research, told CNBC.\"However, competing with Nvidia still presents substantial challenges in technological gaps, especially in general-purpose GPU. Matching Nvidia in short-term is unlikely.\" Chinese firms have a \"lack of technology expertise\", according to Sun, highlighting one of the challenges.However, it's the U.S. sanctions and their knock-on effects that pose the biggest roadblocks to China's ambitions.Some of China's leading Nvidia challengers have been placed on the U.S. Entity List, a blacklist which restricts their access to American technology. Meanwhile, a number of U.S. curbs have restricted key AI-related semiconductors and machinery from being exported to China.China's GPU players all design chips and rely on a manufacturing company to produce their chips. For a while, this would have been Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., or TSMC. But U.S. restrictions mean many of these firms cannot access the chips made by TSMC.They therefore have to turn to SMIC, China's biggest chipmaker, whose technology remains generations behind TSMC. Part of the reason why it's lagging behind, is because Washington has restricted SMIC's access to a key piece of machinery from Dutch firm ASML, which is required to manufacture the most advance chips. Meanwhile, Huawei has been pushing development of more advanced chips for its smartphones and AI chips, which is taking up capacity at SMIC, according to Paul Triolo, a partner at consulting firm Albright Stonebridge.\"The key bottleneck will be domestic foundry leader SMIC, which will have a complex problem of dividing limited resources for its advanced node production between Huawei, which is taking up the lion's share currently, the GPU startups, and many other Chinese design firms which have been or may be cutoff from using global foundry leader TSMC to manufacture their advanced designs,\" Triolo told CNBC. Nvidia has found success due to its advanced semiconductors, but also with its CUDA software platform that allows developers to create applications to run on the U.S. chipmaker's hardware. This has led to the development of a so-called ecosystem around Nvidia's products that others might find hard to replicate.\"This is the key, it is not just about the hardware, but about the overall ecosystem, tools for developers, and the ability to continue to evolve this ecosystem going forward as the technology advances,\" Triolo said. Triolo identified Huawei as one of the leaders in China with its Ascend series of data center processors.The firm's current generation of chip is called the Ascend 910B, and the company is gearing up to launch the Ascend 910C, which could be on par with Nvidia's H100 product, according to a\u00a0Wall Street Journal report\u00a0in August.In its annual report earlier this year, Nvidia explicitly identified Huawei, among other companies, as a competitor in areas such as chips, software for AI and networking products. In the area of software and building a developer community, Huawei \"holds lots of advantages,\" Triolo said. But it faces similar challenges to the rest of the industry in trying to compete with Nvidia.\"The GPU software support ecosystem is much more entrenched around Nvidia and to a lesser degree AMD, and Huawei faces major challenges, both in producing sufficient quantities of advanced GPUs such as part of the Ascend 910C, and continuing to innovate and improve the performance of the hardware, given U.S. export controls that are limiting the ability of SMIC to produce advanced semiconductors,\" Triolo said. The challenges facing China's Nvidia competitors have been evident over the past two years. In 2022, Biren Technology carried out a round of layoffs, followed by Moore Threads the year after, with both companies blaming U.S. sanctions.But startups are still holding out hope, looking to raise money to fund their goals. Bloomberg reported last week that Enflame and Biren are both looking to go public to raise money.\"Biren and the other GPU startups are staffed with experienced industry personnel from Nvidia, AMD, and other leading western semiconductor companies, but they have the additional challenge of lacking the financial depth that Huawei has,\" Triolo said.\"Hence both Biren and Enflame are seeking IPOs in Hong Kong, to raise funding for additional hiring and expansion.\" " }, { "page": "https://www.cnbc.com/technology/?page=3", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/18/youtube-announces-ai-features-from-google-deepmind-for-shorts-creators.html", "date": "Wed, Sep 18th 2024", "author": "Zach Vallese", "title": "YouTube announces AI features from Google DeepMind for Shorts creators", "content": "YouTube on Wednesday announced artificial intelligence features for creators on its Shorts platform that tap into Google's DeepMind video-generation model.The features, known as Veo, will allow creators to add AI-generated backgrounds to their videos as well as use written prompts to generate stand-alone, six-second video clips. YouTube CEO Neal Mohan said he hopes Veo will enable creators to produce more Shorts videos with the help of AI.\"Everything that we showed with AI was meant to really enhance the work that you do, make it faster, more efficient, to bring your creative ideas to life faster,\" said Mohan, speaking at the Made on YouTube event in New York.The Veo AI backgrounds are an upgrade over a similar AI-generation feature announced by YouTube in 2023 called Dream Screen.

Those features will roll out in late 2024, YouTube said.Creators have been exploring various ways to leverage generative AI technology. Creators have used the new technology to insert clips in their videos or produce entirely AI-generated videos.However, some creators expressed concerns that their videos on YouTube are used to train the AI models that built Veo.\"I don't know how I feel about all this AI stuff,\" said Thomas Simons, a comedian with more than 15 million subscribers on YouTube. \"It doesn't fill me with confidence and love.\"There has been criticism that other services such as Facebook have become overrun by spammy, AI-generated content.

The hackers have used various tactics including spear phishing.The Biden administration said on Sept. 4 that it's targeting Russian government-sponsored attempts to affect U.S. public opinion.\"We will be relentlessly aggressive in countering and disrupting attempts by Russia, Iran, as well as China or any other foreign malign actor\" attempting to \"interfere in elections and undermine our members,\" Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement at the time.X's absence from the Wednesday hearing follows a streak of divisive posts by Musk, the world's richest person, on the app, formerly known as Twitter, which he acquired in 2022. Musk has nearly 200 million listed followers.After a second apparent assassination attempt against Republican former Trump on Sunday, Musk\u00a0shared and then deleted a\u00a0post in which he wondered why \"no one\" was making\u00a0assassination\u00a0threats against\u00a0Biden\u00a0and Vice President\u00a0Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee.

TF Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said the problem is that Apple Intelligence isn't out at launch. Barclays also feared it may be because the Chinese language version of Apple Intelligence won't launch until 2025.Here's what you need to know about the new iPhone 16 Pro Max, as of now. The biggest change you'll notice is the new camera button. I'm still getting used to it after a few days, but I'm already defaulting to just pulling the phone out of my pocket, tapping the button and taking a picture.My wife rightly asked me why I don't just hit the camera button on the lock screen like on earlier iPhones. I don't have a good answer for that. It just feels more natural to push a camera button.I enjoyed doing a half-press to get camera controls like the zoom during my son's first soccer game, though I found it was easier to sometimes just pinch to zoom. The new 48-megapixel wide-angle lens offers sharper images in zoomed-out shots that can capture more scenery.Videographers will likely enjoy the 4K 120fps recording offered on the iPhone 16 Pro Max. Still, I try to keep my clips in lower quality because I'm sharing them over text messages with family and friends.The iPhone 16 Pro Max has the best battery life of any iPhone yet. Apple's new A18 Pro processor paired with a larger battery offers up to 33 hours of video playback, up from 29 hours on last year's iPhone 15 Pro Max. I was usually able to make it to about dinnertime before needing to charge the 15, and I can make it to bedtime \u2014 or beyond \u2014 with the new phone depending on how much I'm using it.I love that Apple increased the speed of its MagSafe charging. I used MagSafe when it came out but ultimately switched back to regular cable charging because it was quicker. Now, MagSafe gives up to a 50% charge in 30 minutes if you're using a 30-watt charger (not included.)The screens are slightly larger on this year's Pro models. The iPhone 16 Pro Max moved from 6.7 inches to 6.9 inches. I didn't notice a difference and could only tell when I put the two phones next to each other. It's still a fantastic screen with a high refresh rate, which means scrolling is smooth. It's colorful and bright and I love the always-on display for seeing notifications without picking up my phone. It's not new this year but still useful and limited to the Pro models. In the absence of Apple Intelligence at launch, I'm limited to testing a few beta features. They're hit or miss, as to be expected in beta.Apple Intelligence could help drive a new cycle of iPhone upgrades. Apple reported $39.3 billion in iPhone sales during the fiscal third quarter, about 46% of the company's total revenue and down 1% from a year earlier. CEO Tim Cook said the segment grew on a constant currency basis.I like email summaries provided by Apple Intelligence. They're accurate and give you just a couple of lines that summarize what's said or relayed in an email. This only works in Apple's Mail app, though, so it won't work if your company makes you use Outlook or if you prefer Gmail. Similarly, I found that Apple Intelligence accurately summarized long bits of text (including the introduction to this review) and returned an accurate snippet.\u00a0In notifications, it's just OK. Summaries of news alerts were correct. Summaries of text messages sometimes were unnecessary. In one text from my wife, for example, Apple Intelligence suggested I threw a dinosaur at my daughter and made her cry before I apologized. In reality, my son was the culprit. The original text would have been sufficient.\u00a0In a daycare app notification that I use, Apple Intelligence did a good job summarizing that my daughter \"took a nap, ate Cheerios, and is playing happily.\" That would be a perfect amount of information to receive while driving. Another Apple Intelligence feature can help you create movie memories, which are little snippets of photos and videos set to music. In a TV ad, Apple shows a young woman using it to create memories of a dead goldfish with the help of Siri.I couldn't use Siri to create movies like that. Instead, I opened the Photos app, tapped Memories and wrote in a prompt asking for a photo memory of my son \"learning to fish at Skytop set to a fishing tune.\" It correctly showed pictures of a family trip to the Poconos but didn't include any pictures of my son fishing there. The music was called \"Fishing Tune\" by Jiang Jiaqiang but didn't sound like fishing music to me. Another test, asking for a photo memory of my son \"playing soccer,\" worked better but also included a picture of him as a baby with a football in his hands.There's also the whole new Siri interface that glows along the edges of the screen. I like the look compared to the globe, and it's easier to type to Siri by tapping the screen indicator at the bottom of the display. Siri doesn't feel drastically changed to me right now, although I liked that I could ask iPhone-specific questions like \"How do I use my iPhone to scan a document?\" and \"How do I take a screen recording?\" Siri presents the answer in a simple step-by-step guide at the top of the screen.You can speak to Siri with interruptions now, too. So, if you get stumped while you're thinking and say \"umm\" or \"hold on a second,\" you can continue to ask questions in the same line of thought, like \"How tall is the Eiffel Tower?\" and then follow with, \"And when was it built?\" But it doesn't always work. I tried \"How far is Boston?\" for example, followed by, \"And what's the weather there?\" Siri gave me the weather for my current location.\u00a0Apple Intelligence can be useful and I'm excited to see where it goes. I focused this review on the iPhone 16 Pro Max. The iPhone 16 is slightly smaller and has a little less battery life but is otherwise identical. My colleague used the regular iPhone 16.There are a few differences between the two. The iPhone 16 comes in more colors and is built out of aluminum instead of titanium like the higher-end Pro models. It also has the new camera button but lacks the higher refresh rate and the always-on features of the Pro model displays.The iPhone 16 will support all of the Apple Intelligence features I've mentioned above, plus the ones that are still coming. Apple also upgraded the processor for faster performance and added a new macro camera mode for up-close pictures of objects, as well as support for capturing spatial images for the Apple Vision Pro headset. It offers up to 22 hours of video playback versus the 20 hours in last year's iPhone 15. The iPhone 16 Pro Max is a solid upgrade, but you'll probably find the biggest changes if you're coming from an iPhone 14 Pro Max or earlier. The biggest improvements over last year's phone are the added camera button, a faster chip, new cameras and a slightly larger display.\u00a0When it comes to Apple Intelligence, we'll all have to wait for features like using Siri to ask about prior calendar events, questions that require personal context, using Siri to control your apps, or Apple's integration with ChatGPT. So if you're buying now, it's for everything but the AI.\u00a0Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.\u00a0 " }, { "page": "https://www.cnbc.com/technology/?page=3", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/18/court-backs-googles-challenge-to-the-eus-1point7-billion-antitrust-fine.html", "date": "Wed, Sep 18th 2024", "author": "Arjun Kharpal", "title": "Google wins court challenge to the EU's $1.7 billion antitrust fine over ad product", "content": "The European Union's second-highest court on Wednesday said a 1.5 billion euro ($1.7 billion) fine imposed on Google by regulators should be annulled, siding with the U.S. tech giant after it challenged the ruling.The case stems from 2019 when the European Commission, the EU's executive arm, said Alphabet owned Google had abused its market dominance in relation to a product called AdSense for Search. This product allowed website owners to deliver ads into the search results on their own pages.Google acts as an intermediary allowing advertisers to serve ads via search on third-party websites.But the commission alleged that Google abused its market dominance by imposing a number of restrictive clauses in contracts with third-party websites, which ultimately prevented rivals from placing their search ads on these websites.The commission fined Google 1.49 billion euros at the time. Google appealed, sending the case to the EU's General Court. The General Court said Wednesday that it \"upholds the majority of the findings\" but \"annuls the decision by which the Commission imposed a fine of\" nearly 1.5 billion euros.The court added that the commission \"failed to take into consideration all the relevant circumstances in its assessment of the duration of the contract clauses\" that it had deemed abusive.A Google spokesperson told CNBC that it would review the full decision closely.\"This case is about a very narrow subset of text-only search ads placed on a limited number of publishers' websites. We made changes to our contracts in 2016 to remove the relevant provisions, even before the Commission's decision. We are pleased that the court has recognized errors in the original decision and annulled the fine,\" the spokesperson said.A spokesperson for the commission said it takes note of the judgement and will reflect on the possible next steps.The commission could appeal this decision which would send it up to European Court of Justice, the EU's top court.There has been a slew of court cases involving the EU and U.S. tech companies reaching their conclusions recently.This month, the ECJ upheld a 2.4 billion euro fine imposed on\u00a0Google\u00a0for abusing its dominant position by favoring its own shopping comparison service.

The directors formed a special committee in late March to explore potential paths forward. Wojcicki submitted a proposal to take the company private in July, but it was rejected by the special committee, in part because it didn't provide a premium to the closing price of 40 cents per share at the time.In a letter to Wojcicki on Tuesday, the directors said they had yet to see a \"fully financed, fully diligenced, actionable proposal that is in the best interests of the non-affiliated shareholders.\"\u00a0The directors said they disagree with Wojcicki about the \"strategic direction for the company,\" so they decided to resign effective immediately.\"That we have not seen any notable progress over the last 5 months leads us to believe no such proposal is forthcoming,\" they wrote. \"The Special Committee is therefore unwilling to consider further extensions, and the Board agrees with the Special Committee's determination.\"Wojcicki wrote in the employee memo, which was viewed by CNBC, that she still sees taking 23andMe private as its \"best opportunity for long term success.\" The company will begin a search for new independent directors to join the board, she added.Far from its onetime valuation of $3.5 billion, 23andMe now has a market cap of under $200 million.

For its launch a month earlier from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida, SpaceX had modified its communication plans and used a new and unapproved launch control room, the FAA said.According to a \"notice of proposed civil penalty,\" the FAA clearly informed SpaceX on June 16, 2023, two days before the launch, that the agency \"would not issue a modification\" to the SpaceX license.

The glasses can produce more compelling digital visuals than the prior version and are built on top of a redesigned software operating system dubbed Snap OS.Additionally, Snap is partnering with ChatGPT creator OpenAI to give developers tools that will allow them to build and port their artificial intelligence features for the smart glasses.Snap's announcement comes days before rival Meta's Connect event, a conference where Facebook's parent typically unveils its latest hardware. Like Meta, Snap has been trying for years to break into consumer hardware. Unlike Meta, Snap's core online advertising business has been struggling.Snap shares fell more than 20% after the company reported its latest quarterly results in August. Investors balked at weaker-than-expected guidance for the third quarter, and the company's revenue for the second quarter trailed analysts' expectations.The previous day Meta reported better-than-expected quarterly results that sent the stock price up 7%. Still, Meta's AR and VR bets continue to rack up losses \u2014 the company's Reality Labs unit posted a $4.5 billion loss in the second quarter. That unit is responsible for the company's Quest virtual reality devices and Ray-Ban smart glasses.Since 2020, Meta has poured more than $63 billion in expenses into its hardware efforts. The company has yet to find meaningful success, but Wall Street has afforded Meta patience with Reality Labs because the company's advertising business is thriving.Meta brought in $131.9 billion in advertising sales for 2023, and reported net income of $39.1 billion for the year. By contrast, Snap recorded $4.6 billion in total revenue and a net loss of $1.3 billion in 2023.\"We are at a point where the challenge with Snap is that it is just functioning at a different scale than Meta,\" said Leo Gebbie, a principal analyst and director at CCS Insight. With Meta selling its Quest VR headsets at a loss in order to lead and influence the overall VR market, Gebbie said he expects the company to follow a similar aggressive pricing strategy if it debuts its own AR device. For Snap to compete, the company's AR device must be \"something really impressive\" that incorporates the best of its core Snapchat app and appeals to the younger demographic that differentiates it from Meta, he said.Snap doesn't break out financials for its hardware efforts as Meta does, but the company has struggled to find success selling hardware.Snap debuted its first internet-connected Spectacles glasses in 2016, pitching the $130 devices as an easy way for users to capture short, first-person videos that they could post on Snapchat. A year later, Snap disclosed that it wrote down nearly $40 million due to losses from unsold Spectacles, underscoring the challenges it faces selling consumer hardware products.Since then, the company has released other versions of its Spectacles smart glasses, including a version for $380 in 2019. In 2021, it sold a pair of glasses with AR capabilities in limited numbers to developers and creators instead of the general public, making the product more of a prototype requiring further improvement before a wider release.Beyond glasses, Snap said in 2022 that it would stop developing its Pixy flying camera drone just months after it released the $230 gadget.In getting out ahead of Meta with its latest AR glasses, Snap is using a strategy taken by the Facebook parent last summer when CEO Mark Zuckerberg disclosed details of the company's Quest 3 VR headset a week before Apple announced its much-anticipated Vision Pro VR headset.Much of Meta's AR strategy involves sprinkling some AR features into its Quest-branded VR headsets while simultaneously pushing its Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, made in partnership with EssilorLuxottica. The two companies on Tuesday announced that they had extended their partnership to continue developing smart glasses.Although Meta doesn't release sales figures, Zuckerberg has told analysts that its Ray-Ban Meta glasses that went on sale in October \"continue to do well and are sold out in many styles and colors, so we're working to make more and release additional styles as quickly as we can.\"Snap CEO Evan Spiegel has centered the company's hardware efforts around camera technology, which he believes is a natural fit with the core Snapchat app and its 850 million monthly active users.It's unclear how much longer investors will stomach Snap's hardware push.\"We have seen the losses on Reality Labs grow quarter by quarter, and investors have indulged this because Meta is making enough profit from its advertising business,\" Gebbie said. \"Snap is hugely more constrained. It's in a position where to meaningfully compete on hardware is going to be incredibly challenging.\"WATCH: Jim Cramer discusses Snap and the market " }, { "page": "https://www.cnbc.com/technology/?page=3", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/17/apple-watch-series-10-review.html", "date": "Tue, Sep 17th 2024", "author": "Todd Haselton", "title": "Apple Watch Series 10 offers minor upgrades, but faster charging is a big plus", "content": "The new Apple Watch Series 10 hits stores on Friday. I've been testing it for the past five days, and there are enough refinements to appeal to first timers and those considering an upgrade.I wasn't necessarily excited when Apple announced the new watches earlier this month. The company revealed a slightly thinner design, somewhat larger screens and some software features that will apply to earlier models. But taken together, there's a good amount to like.The Apple Watch is part of the company's Wearables, Home and Accessories unit, which reported $8.1 billion in revenue during the fiscal third quarter, down 2% from a year ago. CEO Tim Cook said at the time of the report that two-thirds of Apple Watch buyers are still new to the device.The Apple Watch Series 10, as its name implies, marks the tenth year of the Apple Watch. It's the best yet, even if some changes are minimal. The charging is great. The Series 10 has new coils under the back glass that charge it to 80% in 30 minutes. I could get plenty of juice for the day ahead by plugging it in while reading a book or taking a shower. A full charge lasts 18 hours, which has been standard since the Series 1.The screens are slightly bigger, which is nice for typing and selecting songs in a playlist or tapping buttons. I've been using my personal Apple Watch Series Ultra for the past couple of years and have adjusted to it, but the bigger display makes a big difference when you're trying to tap out a quick response to a text message.I like the new speakers that allow you to listen to podcasts, music or audiobooks without using headphones. I don't find myself often in a spot without my phone or my AirPods, but sometimes I leave my phone charging downstairs. It was nice to keep listening to part of an audiobook I had started in the car while I was putting my clothes away after work.Apple added new features such as an option to detect sleep apnea, which received Food and Drug Administration approval Monday and will be ready when the watches start reaching consumers on Friday. It's already available for the Apple Watch Series 9. I'm excited to try it since I've been treated for sleep apnea in the past and I'm aware of how problematic it can be if undetected. Finally, I love the move from steel to titanium on the higher-end models. Apple's polished steel versions were always my favorite but they were heavier than the aluminum options. The titanium is much lighter.I really like the appearance of the shiny black aluminum option. It looks more expensive than the matte silver or rose gold models but starts at the same price: $399. The Series 10 is thinner than earlier Apple Watches, which weren't particularly thick. I'd be fine with the prior thickness if it meant longer battery life.That remains the biggest weakness. The Apple Watch Ultra and Ultra 2 are compelling in part because they offer up to 36 hours of battery life. It makes a huge difference when traveling or if you just forget to plug it in one night.There aren't a lot of big health upgrades. Apple is reportedly working on blood glucose monitoring or blood pressure monitoring for the Apple Watch. I wasn't expecting either this year, but I worry about spending money on a device now only to have it outdated when big health features drop. The Apple Watch Series 10 is a great first buy for the two-thirds of folks who are making a first-time Apple Watch purchase. You're getting a new chip, a bigger screen, a thinner design and faster charging. Owners of a Series 6 or older might also see enough to justify an upgrade. But if you're into more extreme sports such as diving or hiking and need features including extra accurate GPS and support for deeper water submersion, or just much longer battery life, I'd recommend the Apple Watch Ultra 2 instead.Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.\u00a0 " }, { "page": "https://www.cnbc.com/technology/?page=3", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/17/tech-dealmakers-skeptical-that-ma-will-pick-up-after-election.html", "date": "Wed, Sep 18th 2024", "author": "Jordan Novet", "title": "Harris-Trump contest has Big Tech 'at a crossroads' after slump in dealmaking", "content": "Google had been in talks to acquire marketing software maker HubSpot earlier this year, but no deal took place. The company then made a run at cybersecurity startup Wiz. But that didn't happen either.Google took a different tactic in closing its one notable transaction of late. Following a model pursued by Amazon and Microsoft to lure experts in artificial intelligence, Google announced last month it was hiring the founders of generative AI startup Character.AI. Rather than buying Character outright and shutting it down \u2014 the standard acquihire playbook \u2014 Google kept the startup alive and entered into a licensing deal for its technology.This is the new world of tech M&A. Under the Biden administration, and more specifically Federal Trade Commission head Lina Khan, the biggest companies have been thwarted from pursuing large deals. In some cases, they've even walked away from smaller deals. Amazon abandoned its $1.7 billion purchase of iRobot in January after the FTC and European regulators raised concerns.Since peaking at $1.5 trillion in 2021, tech transaction volume has plummeted, dropping to $544 billion last year, according to Dealogic. So far in 2024, that number sits at $465 billion.Within tech, private equity buyers are the ones keeping the market afloat. In July, BlackRock agreed to buy data provider Preqin for $3.2 billion, two months after Permira announced it was buying website-building platform Squarespace in a deal valued at almost $7 billion. Thoma Bravo, a leading tech buyout firm, said in July it was selling Instructure to KKR for $4.8 billion.Don't expect much to change for the rest of this year. With the presidential election coming in November, the regulatory environment could be poised for a shake-up, potentially leading to the removal of deal-making barriers.However, neither party offers much clarity for what the future would bring. Sen. JD Vance, Donald Trump's running mate on the Republican ticket, has praised Khan's stricter rules on mergers, and he told CNBC last week that \"there should be an antitrust solution\" to some of the behaviors of large tech platforms. On the Democratic side, billionaire donors Barry Diller and\u00a0Reid\u00a0Hoffman have voiced concerns about Khan keeping her job if Vice President Kamala Harris wins.\"If Trump wins, I think that the regulatory environment will still be fairly challenging, and under a challenging regulatory environment, that just limits big deals,\" said Andrew Luh, a partner at law firm Gunderson Dettmer who represents startups in mergers and acquisitions.The Biden administration's crackdown on Big Tech has gone well beyond squashing M&A.Alphabet is in the midst of its second antitrust trial, following charges from the Justice Department that the company acted as a monopoly in search and advertising. The DOJ sued Apple on antitrust grounds in March. The FTC has cases pending against Meta and Amazon.Couple that with a similarly rigid environment in Europe, and no deal appears safe. In December, Adobe walked away from its $20 billion agreement to purchase design software startup Figma, and paid a $1 billion breakup fee. In a\u00a0statement, the companies said, \"there is no clear path to receive necessary regulatory approvals from the European Commission and the UK Competition and Markets Authority.\"In July, Figma said it had completed a tender offer valuing the design software startup at $12.5 billion. Figma is viewed as a strong IPO candidate when that market eventually reopens. But alongside a plummeting M&A market, initial public offerings are also in an extended drought as companies continue to adapt to drastically reduced valuations wrought by the economic slowdown starting in 2022.A Figma spokesperson declined to comment on the company's plans.Dana Rao, who at the time was Adobe's general counsel, announced his departure earlier this month after 12 years at the company. Rao said in a December interview that Adobe leadership felt justified in pursuing Figma after the failure of its competing product design program. But regulators were taking a different view.\"We've had a lot of interaction with the regulators, and they've been very focused on the newer doctrines of antitrust law that say that future competition is a critical part of the antitrust analysis,\" he said.Jonathan Kanter, head of the Justice Department's Antitrust Division, said in a statement after Adobe backed down that the move \"ensures that designers, creators, and consumers continue to get the benefit of the rivalry between the two companies going forward.\" There are still deals taking place outside of the strict regulatory constraints of megacap tech.Hewlett Packard Enterprise agreed in January to acquire networking hardware company Juniper for $14 billion. And this month, Salesforce said it was buying startup Own for $1.9 billion.In some cases, management has been less concerned about regulators and much more focused on how shareholders would respond due to the growing obsession with profitability, following the 2022 downturn. HPE CEO Antonio Neri told CNBC that Juniper would add to non-GAAP earnings in year one.\"We have been very, very disciplined on returning invested capital, meaning every dollar spent has to deliver value to our shareholders,\" Neri said in an interview. \"And that's why, in the case of Juniper, for example, we committed to a series of synergies that then more than pay for the cost of capital to make this acquisition.\"Neri told analysts in January that the two companies do business in some of the same markets, but in different verticals, and said that he didn't anticipate protracted battles with regulators. In August, the U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority approved the tie-up.Sergio Letelier, HPE's head of corporate development, said that when he and his team members advise Neri on a potential deal, they always discuss how regulators might treat it. While some transactions are taking longer to close than they would have previously, \"the fundamentals of what is a problematic deal vs. what is not a problematic deal hasn't changed,\" Letelier said.At Salesforce, CEO Marc Benioff said that Own should bolster free cash flow in the second year after the deal closed. It's Benioff's first billion-dollar-plus acquisition since 2021, when the cloud software vendor paid $27 billion for Slack, its largest purchase ever. The DOJ's Antitrust Division asked for additional information on that deal before clearing it.In an interview last week, Benioff called U.S. regulators \"somewhat dysfunctional\" but applauded Europe for recognizing where competition really is being harmed. He specifically pointed to a recent finding by the European Commission, the executive body of the European Union, that Microsoft had breached antitrust rules by tying Teams, its Slack competitor, to its core Office productivity applications.\"They're the ones who are actually functional and who are doing serious work,\" Benioff said, referring to the EU and U.K. \"I think that it's a big story that we're following the Europeans in this regulatory environment.\"Since the Slack purchase, Salesforce has pursued only smaller deals, particularly after facing off with activist investors who pressured the company to put a renewed focus on profitability. Salesforce landed AI talent from buying Airkit and a Sales Cloud software add-on from Spiff.\"We've done more than 60 acquisitions,\" Benioff said. \"We've tried and failed a lot in M&A, but we have also succeeded in quite a few of them, especially the big ones.\" Before Slack, Salesforce acquired Tableau Software and MuleSoft. At Cisco, one of the first questions executives ask when evaluating a potential deal is how certain they are it will close, said Derek Idemoto, the networking hardware company's head of corporate development.\"The question is, How much risk are you willing to take on the regulatory side, given how hard things are at this time and how litigious things could be,\" said Idemoto, who's worked on more than 100 deals in his nearly 17 years at the company.Idemoto said that's made Cisco more selective these days. Before the company announced its $27 billion purchase of data analytics software company Splunk last September, he said he viewed the risk as absolutely worth taking. Splunk sat comfortably outside Cisco's core of networking equipment.\"Certainly it's an offensive play for us,\" Idemoto said.The deal sailed through, even closing in March, six months ahead of schedule.\"Having a high confidence level when you sign something \u2014 that's the Cisco way,\" Idemoto said.That level of confidence would be difficult for the megacap companies as long as the FTC and DOJ are aggressively watching them. Alphabet's last big deal was its $5.4 billion purchase of cybersecurity company Mandiant in 2022. Microsoft closed its massive $75 billion purchase of Activision in October, but it took 20 months and a protracted fight with U.S. and European regulators. Amazon hasn't had a billion-dollar-plus deal since closing the $3.9 billion acquisition of One Medical in early 2023.Last month, Amazon announced it was hiring a quarter of staffers from Covariant, which builds AI models for robots. It was the company's second AI deal in the acquihire vein, following a similar agreement with Adept in June. Even that deal attracted an informal FTC inquiry.Amazon didn't provide a specific comment for this story, but said acquisitions are still part of its growth strategy and \"are a critical and healthy part of an innovation economy.\" Microsoft and Google declined to comment.HPE's Letelier, who spoke to CNBC when President Biden was still the Democratic presumptive nominee, said that any tech company considering its acquisition strategy will have a difficult time forecasting for the future because it's not clear what changes will be in store.Trump as president blocked some deals on national security grounds, following recommendations from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. Regulators under Biden, meanwhile, have filed a record number of merger enforcement actions, Bloomberg reported.\"We're at a crossroads here, and we don't know which side of the fork the policy is going to go,\" Letelier said.Correction: A prior version of this story mistakenly suggested that HPE was less concerned about regulation than profitability with respect to its purchase of Juniper. Also, the interview with Letelier took place while Biden was still the Democratic presumptive nominee for president, so a reference to Vice President Harris has been removed from his comment.

When Prime launched in 2005, two-day shipping was unheard of. By 2019, one-day shipping was standard\u00a0for millions of items. Now, the retail giant is turning to generative AI to drive more same-day shipping.Amazon is using the technology to optimize delivery routes, make more intelligent warehouse robots, create more-ergonomic environments for employees and better predict where to stock new items, said Steve Armato, Amazon's vice president of transportation technology and services.During an exclusive tour of Amazon's largest California sort center, located in Tracy, Armato told CNBC that 60% of Prime orders in March were delivered the same day or next day in the top 60 metropolitan areas in the U.S.\u00a0Amazon is betting on generative AI to increase that figure. \u00a0\"It seems subtle, but at this scale, getting just one more product in the right spot means that it's shipping less distance when you order it,\" Armato said in an interview at the warehouse.In 2020, Amazon began developing models for demand forecasting and supply chain optimization using transformer architecture, the backbones of what we know today as generative AI.\u00a0\"Generative AI is the next big evolution in technology,\" Armato said. \"It's remarkable, and we're already applying it in very practical ways across our operations.\"But not all the changes that generative AI may bring to the e-commerce giant are positive. There are concerns about the high-energy needs of generative AI and about its ability to enable robots to replace Amazon's human workforce, analysts told CNBC. The number of Amazon warehouse robots grew from 350,000 in 2021 to more than 750,000 in 2023, according to the company.Amazon began adding AI transformer models to its warehouse delivery robots in 2022 so the machines can dash around each other more intelligently. CNBC watched hundreds of them move in a coordinated grid in the warehouse. Armato calls this \"the dance floor.\"\"Some of the two-day deliveries might stand aside, let the robot with a next-day delivery go on its mission first and take a straight line to its destination,\" Armato said.\u00a0 While these robots navigate using a series of QR codes, Amazon's next generation of drive units, called Proteus, are fully autonomous, the company said.\u00a0\"They're using generative AI and computer vision to avoid obstacles and find the right place to stop,\" Armato said.\u00a0As part of the company's AI strategy, Amazon in August struck a\u00a0deal with AI startup Covariant. Amazon hired the startup's founders and licensed its models that help robots handle a wider range of physical objects. Amazon is also developing a bipedal robot called Digit that can grasp and handle items in a humanoid way.CNBC saw a row of 20 robotic \"Robin\" arms that use computer vision to determine how much pressure to use when picking up various package shapes and sizes. Amazon said generative AI teaches the arms how to handle products they've never seen before based on data from similar products in Amazon's\u00a0vast catalog.A similar model is used to better assess damaged items and keep them from shipping out. Amazon's AI is three times better at identifying damaged products than humans are, the company said.Introducing more robotics with generative AI without replacing human workers is a balancing act for Amazon, said Tom Forte, senior equity analyst at the Maxim Group.\"How can they implement automation to improve efficiency and manage labor expenses, but how can they do it in a way that complements their use of humans and doesn't replace them?\" Forte said.Rather than replacing workers, the robots are reducing the burden on employees and creating new roles, Armato said.\u00a0Amazon said it plans to spend $1.2 billion to upskill more than 300,000 employees by the end of 2025 as generative AI and robotics change the company's processes.\u00a0\"Someone needs to maintain [the robot] if it breaks down,\" Armato said. \"Or if something does get dropped on the dance floor, we have a process and special training to go clean that up. And so each of those creates new categories of jobs, some of which have higher earnings potential.\"Amazon has faced scrutiny in recent years over its workplace injury record, with federal citations for safety violations and a yearlong Senate probe that found that Amazon's big annual sale, Prime Day, was a \"major\" cause of worker injuries. Amazon appealed the citations and said the report ignores progress it's made.\u00a0Many of Amazon's robots move tall bins of items to workstations where employees pick and pack them, which reduces how much humans have to walk, Armato said. AI is also reducing the need for workers to reach and bend, he said.\"One algorithmic improvement is to take our faster-selling products and place those on the shelves at waist height,\" Armato said. \"That's your ergonomic power zone.\" With all those robots and workers,\u00a0Amazon delivered more than 2 billion items the same day or next day in the first quarter of 2024, according to the company. \u00a0Amazon has always used algorithms to predict how much of what inventory is needed, when and where. The company said it's using generative AI to predict where best to place items it hasn't previously sold.\u00a0\"When we place a product in the right place ahead of time, before you click buy, it's traveling less distance, which is a win for speed and sustainability,\" Armato said.Amazon Web Services has data centers filled with servers running AI workloads that give the company an edge over its retail rivals because it can train its AI in-house. As an early online-only retailer, Amazon got a head start on collecting mass aggregate data on shopping behavior and delivery logistics. Amazon is now using that trove of data to create AI models for use in everything from supply chain optimization to warehouse robotics, according to the company.\"It's not that Walmart and Target and Costco and others don't have their own reams of data, but they're looking at things a little bit differently, and they have much older systems,\" said Sucharita Kodali, retail analyst at Forrester Research. \u00a0How eco-friendly generative AI will be in the long run is unclear. That's because training and running generative AI is a carbon-intensive process, and by 2027, AI servers worldwide are projected to use as much power every year as Sweden or the Netherlands. \u00a0That's in conflict with Amazon's 2019 commitment to reach net-zero carbon by 2040.The company claims that the use of AI is helping cut down the carbon footprint of package delivery. Amazon is reducing carbon by using more than 20 machine learning models to improve mapping for its vast network of 390,000 delivery drivers, predicting road closures and choosing more efficient routes, the company said.\u00a0Beyond its warehouses, Amazon has also introduced generative AI to help its sellers and shoppers.The company's new Amazon Personalize AI tool generates hyper-personalized product recommendations. Sellers can also use generative AI to write highly targeted product descriptions or generate images of their products in different \"seasonal and lifestyle\" settings.\u00a0For shoppers, Amazon in 2023 began populating its website with AI-generated summaries of product reviews, and in February, the company launched a generative-AI powered conversational shopping assistant called Rufus.\u00a0Additionally, Amazon said, it has invested $4 billion in AI startup Anthropic, which makes chatbot Claude, a competitor to OpenAI's ChatGPT. Amazon also makes its own AI-focused microchips and its own generative AI tools for developers, which it also uses in operations, the company said.Whether Amazon's huge investment in generative AI will translate to profits remains an open question.\u00a0\"I have yet to see huge lift in anybody's retail business due to generative AI, including Amazon,\" Kodali said. \"I think a lot of their biggest impact has happened because of the earlier investments, not necessarily some of these more recent investments.\"Watch the video for more on how Amazon is using AI.

The company believes this will simplify its structure and help investors understand the business better.Shares of THG closed down more than 12% Tuesday on the back of the news.THG formed THG Ingenuity in 2021 as a separate venture selling e-commerce solutions for retailers. THG's Moulding has previously described THG Ingenuity as a \"social media influencer platform\" to promote products, including brands sold by THG as well as those sold by other companies, too.The venture was formed with the help of Japanese tech investing heavyweight SoftBank, which in May 2021 bought an 8% stake in THG for \u00a3481 million. The deal at the time gave SoftBank the option to invest an additional $1.6 billion in THG Ingenuity.However, in October 2022, SoftBank ended its investment deal with THG and sold its entire stake in the company to Moulding. In addition to pursuing a spinoff for its Ingenuity arm, THG is also planning to transfer all its currently publicly-traded shares to the newly created equity shares commercial companies (ESCC) segment of the London Stock Exchange. Previously, THG was listed on the standard segment of the LSE. However, firms listed in this category on the stock exchange aren't eligible to be considered for inclusion in major blue-chip stock indexes, like the FTSE 100.After tech executives and investors bemoaned London's IPO market structure, officials within the LSE, U.K. government and Financial Conduct Authority worked together to reform London's listings rules and make the exchange a more attractive venue for high-growth tech firms.Earlier this year, the FCA\u00a0introduced the ESCC, among other changes, as part of the wider reforms to Britain's listings environment.THG said the new listings structure for the firm would boost its chances of being considered for inclusion in U.K. stock indexes and, in turn, improve passive investment flows and liquidity for company shares. THG has struggled to restore the value of its shares to the monster highs of the tech rally of 2020 and 2021, when investors were throwing cash at business benefiting from stay-at-home trends and a broader long-term shift towards online shopping.Shares hit an all-time intraday high of \u00a38 a share in December 2020.Today, they're trading at 57.65p, a fraction of the value they were worth at the peak of the Covid-driven boom in tech and e-commerce stocks.In tandem with the firm's struggles with the market, Moulding has been a prominent critic of London's market for tech listings, telling GQ Magazine in 2021 that THG's IPO \"sucked from start to finish\" and was ultimately a \"mistake.\"He also said at the time that it would have been better to float THG in the U.S. rather than the U.K. " }, { "page": "https://www.cnbc.com/technology/?page=3", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/17/big-ai-models-will-be-commoditized-infosys-chair-says.html", "date": "Tue, Sep 17th 2024", "author": "Arjun Kharpal", "title": "Big AI models will be commoditized, Infosys chair says", "content": "Massive artificial intelligence models built by the likes of OpenAI will eventually become commoditized with the next wave of value in the technology coming from the applications that are built on top of the models, the co-founder and chair of Infosys told CNBC on Tuesday.Large language models are the AI models trained on amounts of data and they underpin applications like ChatGPT.

While Nvidia can ship certain chips to China, Washington has shown its willingness to cut its tech rival off from the most cutting-edge semiconductors and tools needed to make them. This has renewed focus on China's homegrown efforts to rival Nvidia and create semiconductors that can underpin the world's second-largest economy's own AI industry.CNBC spoke to two analysts who identified some of the leading Chinese competitors to Nvidia. Huawei is one of China's tech champions with a business that spans telecommunications infrastructure to consumer electronics and cloud computing. Its chip design unit is called HiSilicon.The Shenzhen-headquartered company designs the Ascend series of data center processors. Huawei then sells these chips as a part of servers that go into data centers to train AI models. Its AI servers are under the brand name Atlas.The firm's current generation of chip is called the Ascend 910B, and the company is gearing up to launch the Ascend 910C, which could be on par with Nvidia's H100 product, according to a Wall Street Journal report in August.In its annual report earlier this year, Nvidia explicitly identified Huawei, among other companies, as a competitor in areas such as chips, software for AI and networking products.\"It is not just about the hardware, but about the overall ecosystem, tools for developers, and the ability to continue to evolve this ecosystem going forward as the technology advances. Here, Huawei holds a lot of advantages, and is attempting to build a software ecosystem around its Ascend series of datacenter processors,\" Paul Triolo, a partner at consulting firm Albright Stonebridge, told CNBC. Alibaba and Baidu both buy Nvidia chips but they are also designing their own semiconductors for AI processes.Baidu, one of China's biggest internet companies, designs its own chips for the use in servers and autonomous cars under the brand name Kunlun.Alibaba's semiconductor design unit called T-Head, has developed an AI inference chip called the Hanguang 800. Inference is the process that follows the training of AI models, as it refers to the actual application of AI in the real world, such as a chatbot responding to user queries.\"Alibaba's AI inference chip has already been deployed to accelerate its recommendation system on its e-commerce platform. Baidu has integrated its Kunlun chip into its data centers and autonomous driving sector,\" Wei Sun, a senior analyst at Counterpoint Research, told CNBC. Like Nvidia, Biren Technology designs a general purpose GPU and has a software development platform to build applications on top of the hardware.These chips form part of Biren's Bili series of products designed to be used in data centers for AI training.Last year Biren was added to a U.S. blacklist known as the Entity List, which restricts its access to certain American technology. Cambricon Technologies designs various types of semiconductors from those designed to train AI models to those that can run AI applications on devices, rather than in data centers.However, the company has continued to report significant losses and reportedly laid off workers last year, according to the South China Morning Post.Cambricon Technologies is also on the U.S. Entity List. Moore Threads, founded in 2020, is developing GPUs designed to train large AI models.MTT KUAE\u00a0is the company's data center product containing its GPUs. The company's mission is to become a \"global GPU leader,\" according to a statement on its website.It also has big brand names backing it. TikTok-owner ByteDance is an investor alongside big venture capital firms including Sequoia and GGV Capital.Moore Threads is also on the U.S. Entity List. Enflame Technology is another start-up in China vying to position itself as a homegrown alternative to Nvidia.

The foundry business, which Intel plans to use to manufacture chips for other customers, has been a big drag on its bottom line, with the company spending roughly $25 billion on it in each of the last two years.Beyond just considering outside funding, Intel is weighing whether to spin off the foundry business, possibly into a separate publicly traded company, according to a person with knowledge of the matter who declined to be named in order to discuss confidential information.With a standalone \"operating board\" and a cleaner corporate structure, the mechanics of a separation become far easier than trying to turn a fully integrated unit into a separate company.Prior to the postmarket pop, Intel had lost almost 60% of its value this year. The company has given up market share in its core PC and data center business and watched Nvidia run away with the market for chips that power artificial intelligence workloads.

U.S. manufacturing projects will remain unaffected, the company said.Earlier on Monday, Intel was awarded up to $3 billion from the Biden administration and the CHIPS and Science Act, an effort to bring chipmaking to the U.S. The funding is for the \"Secure Enclave\" program, which furthers a project between Intel and the Department of Defense.The U.S. government is bolstering its investment in semiconductor production due largely to the growing geopolitical risk around Taiwan, home to the world's largest contract chipmaker, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing. U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo recently met with Gelsinger, who voiced his frustration over domestic chipmakers' heavy reliance on Taiwan Semiconductor. In addition to the foundry announcement, Intel said it entered into a deal with Amazon Web Services to produce custom chips for AI, extending a long-running partnership between the two companies. Amazon is a big customer of Intel chips to power its AWS servers, and will buy a custom Xeon processor from Intel as well, Intel said.The move will potentially give Intel a new foothold in the growing industry for AI server chips. While Intel has several products that can be used for AI, including Gaudi 3, Nvidia has largely taken control of the market.Amazon has been developing its own AI chips, including one called Trainium, for over five years. Microsoft and Google have also invested heavily in custom chips to run AI, aiming to offer less expensive processors than Nvidia's general-purpose graphics processing units.Intel said that it would carry out its most advanced manufacturing, including the AI chip for AWS, at its plant in Ohio that's currently under construction.\"All eyes will remain on us,\" Gelsinger said. \"We need to fight for every inch and execute better than ever before. Because that's the only way to quiet our critics and deliver the results we know we're capable of achieving.\"WATCH: Intel awarded up to $3 billion under CHIPS Act " }, { "page": "https://www.cnbc.com/technology/?page=3", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/16/crypto-spend-on-election-hits-190-million-led-by-winklevoss-twins.html", "date": "Tue, Sep 17th 2024", "author": "MacKenzie Sigalos", "title": "Crypto spending on 2024 election hits $190 million, led by Winklevoss twins", "content": "Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss are the biggest individual crypto donors this election cycle, giving a combined $10.1 million, or slightly over $5 million each, according to Federal Election Commission data compiled by crypto market and blockchain analyst James Delmore and independently verified by CNBC.With 50 days to go until the November general election, political donations from, or in support of, the crypto industry are up to around $190 million, as some of the biggest names in the sector open their digital wallets to help elect candidates sympathetic to their interests.The Winklevoss twins gave around $1.7 million combined in bitcoin to the Trump 47 Committee, which raises money for Republican former President Donald Trump, over $700,000 combined to the pro-Trump Make America Great Again PAC, $250,000 each to the pro-Trump America PAC, and $4.9 million to the bipartisan pro-crypto Fairshake PAC.Top executives from blockchain giant Ripple Labs have collectively given more than $3 million to candidate committees and super PACs so far this cycle, with co-founder Chris Larsen donating nearly $2.4 million of that, mostly to help Democratic candidates. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has donated more than $384,000 to multiple PACs and candidates, including to Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) and John Deaton, a Republican running against Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren in Massachusetts. The company's chief legal officer, Stuart Alderoty, gave $300,000 to the Trump 47 Committee.At a fundraiser for Trump in June, Alderoty explained how Ripple had spent over $100 million litigation to defend itself against civil charges brought by the SEC. The event was held at the San Francisco mansion of venture capitalist David Sacks.The Winklevoss twins and Coinbase didn't respond to requests for comment. Ripple referred CNBC to prior comments from executives, including a June post from Garlinghouse on X, where he wrote that \"candidates will only gain votes for being pro-crypto, and absolutely lose them for being anti-crypto.\"The month after the San Francisco fundraiser, Trump promised to fire SEC Chair Gary Gensler if he were elected, even though U.S. presidents do not have the authority to fire members of independent commissions without cause. While the incoming president could unseat Gensler from his position as chairman, he would remain on as a commissioner until the end of his term. Under Gensler, the SEC has taken on major industry players, including centralized cryptocurrency exchanges Kraken and Coinbase.Executives from the two companies have been spending big this cycle. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has given over $1.3 million to a mix of PACs including Fairshake and JD Vance for Senate Inc., as well as directly to Democrats and Republicans running for both House and Senate seats. Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal has attended at least two Trump fundraisers, including one in Nashville on the sidelines of the biggest bitcoin event of the year.Kraken co-founder and Chairman Jesse Powell has donated just over $1 million to the Trump campaign.Individual crypto contributors include ex-Bitfinex strategy chief Phil Potter (over $1.6 million), Multicoin Capital's Kyle Samani ($878,600), Paradigm co-founder Fred Ehrsam ($735,400), Union Square Ventures partner Fred Wilson ($1,4 million), Paxos CEO and co-founder Charles Cascarilla ($198,500), BitGo CEO Mike Belshe ($119,825), Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakavenko ($67,100), and Gibraltar-based Xapo Bank founder Wences Casares ($374,899).According to Delmore's report, no known donations have been made in cryptocurrency to the Future Forward PAC, which is raising funds for Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee for president. Future Forward began accepting crypto donations this month through a partnership with Coinbase Commerce. It appears the donation page on the website still doesn't offer a crypto option. CNBC reached out to two representatives from Future Forward listed on the PAC's FEC filing to ask about the tally of crypto donations thus far and when it plans to add a crypto payment option on its website. They didn't immediately respond.Harris' fundraising operation has taken off since President Biden dropped out of the race, with her campaign raising $47 million in the first 24 hours after her first, and perhaps only, debate against Trump on Tuesday. Delmore, who has been assembling reports on crypto donations in the 2024 election for blockchain analytics platform Breadcrumbs, told CNBC that industry spending is nearly double where it was in the mid-terms \u2014 more than $190 million in the 2024 election versus $98 million in the 2022 election. It's nearly 13 times spending in 2020 of $15 million \u2014 a figure based on a mix of data from FEC and OpenSecrets filings.Unlike the past two election cycles, which featured spending from the now-bankrupt crypto exchange FTX and founder Sam Bankman-Fried, this year's contributor list is more robust and diverse. Bankman-Fried was sentenced to 25 years in prison in March for stealing $8 billion worth of customer money through FTX.\"Most of the crypto donations in 2022 were from FTX and SBF and almost all of them went to Democrats or PACs that support Democrats,\" Delmore said.Delmore said that spending is more balanced between the two parties, but \"more has definitely gone to Republican candidates and PACs that supported Republicans and opposed Democrats.\"A Public Citizen report last month found that nearly half of all the corporate money flowing into this year's election has come from the crypto industry, with Coinbase and Ripple leading the pack.There is a lot of overlap between crypto's biggest corporate and individual spenders.The majority of funds for Fairshake, one of the top-spending PACs this year, can be traced to four sources: Coinbase, Ripple, Jump Crypto and venture firm Andreessen Horowitz.Widening the category to all of crypto, Delmore's research finds that billions of dollars are at play, including more than $20 million in sales generated by non-fungible tokens (NFT) released by Trump, according to Bloomberg reporting, Trump-branded meme tokens, the $190 million in political donations from or in support of crypto, and another $1.1 billion on betting on the platform Polymarket.So far, $922 million in bets have been placed\u00a0on who will be the winner of the election, and another $206 million on\u00a0who will win the popular vote.\u00a0Electing pro-crypto candidates ultimately comes down to turning out the vote.The\u00a0Stand With Crypto Alliance, launched by Coinbase last year, is in the midst of a cross-country bus tour through battleground states to get people registered to vote. The campaign culminates in an event on DC on Wednesday that will include speeches by members of Coinbase's C-suite, as well as a live performance by music duo The Chainsmokers.WATCH: How Trump was 'orange-pilled' " }, { "page": "https://www.cnbc.com/technology/?page=3", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/16/oracles-larry-ellison-dethrones-jeff-bezos-as-worlds-second-richest-man.html", "date": "Mon, Sep 16th 2024", "author": "Annie Palmer", "title": "Larry Ellison becomes world's second-richest man, dethroning Jeff Bezos", "content": "Oracle shares closed up 5.1% on Monday, continuing their recently rally and propelling Chairman Larry Ellison to become the world's second-richest person, snatching the title from Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.Since the close of trading Friday, Ellison's net worth has jumped $8.1 billion to reach roughly $206 billion, according to\u00a0Forbes' real-time billionaires list. Bezos, who had been the second-richest person on and off since 2016, is worth $203 billion. Tesla CEO Elon Musk sits at the top of the list, with a net worth of $251 billion.Oracle's stock has climbed to new highs after the company reported earnings last week that surpassed expectations and boosted its fiscal 2026 revenue forecast. The stock surge caused Ellison to briefly pass Bezos as the world's second-richest person on Friday, before the Amazon founder reclaimed the title.Shares of Oracle are up 20% for the month. If the rally stops there, it would be their best month since October 2022, when the stock soared 28%, and the second-best month since roughly two decades ago in October 2002.Oracle's stock success is partly due to the company's role in the artificial intelligence boom. Ellison, who founded Oracle in 1977, spoke on the company's earnings call last week about how the company is building data centers to accommodate the increasing demand for generative AI.\"We are literally building the smallest, most portable, most affordable cloud data centers all the way up to 200-megawatt data centers, ideal for training very large language models and keeping them up to date,\" Ellison said on the call.Oracle said last week that it would partner with Amazon's cloud computing unit to enable its database services on dedicated hardware.

Now, the company is giving employees until Jan. 2 to start adhering to the new policy.Corporate employees will be expected to be in the office five days a week \"outside of extenuating circumstances\" or unless they have been granted an exception by their organization's S-team leader, Jassy said, referring to the close-knit group of executives that report to Amazon's CEO.\"Before the pandemic, it was not a given that folks could work remotely two days a week, and that will also be true moving forward \u2014 our expectation is that people will be in the office outside of extenuating circumstances,\" Jassy said.Amazon also plans to simplify its corporate structure by having fewer managers in order to \"remove layers and flatten organizations,\" Jassy said. Each S-team organization will be expected to increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers by at least 15% by the end of the first quarter of 2025, he said. Individual contributors refers to employees who typically do not manage other staffers.Amazon said each team will review their structure as part of the process, and that it's possible they'll identify roles that are no longer required. Any changes or adjustments will be announced at the team level, the company added.The company rapidly grew its headcount over the course of the pandemic before Jassy took the helm and instituted widespread cost cuts across Amazon, including the largest layoffs in its 27 years as a public company. Amazon's headcount totaled 1.53 million employees in the second quarter, representing growth of just 5% from a year earlier. By comparison, Amazon's workforce expanded 14% to 1.52 million employees in the second quarter of 2022.Jassy wrote in a lengthy missive to staffers that\u00a0Amazon\u00a0is making the changes to strengthen its corporate culture and ensure that it remains nimble. He underscored the point by saying the company created a \"bureaucracy mailbox,\" or dedicated email alias, to root out any unnecessary processes or excessive rules within the company.\"We want to operate like the world's largest startup,\" Jassy wrote. \"That means having a passion for constantly inventing for customers, strong urgency (for most big opportunities, it's a race!), high ownership, fast decision-making, scrappiness and frugality, deeply-connected collaboration (you need to be joined at the hip with your teammates when inventing and solving hard problems), and a shared commitment to each other.\"Amazon shares ticked lower in afternoon trading.Here is the full memo from Amazon CEO Andy Jassy:Hey team. I wanted to send a note on a couple changes we're making to further strengthen our culture and teams.First, for perspective, I feel good about the progress we're making together. Stores, AWS, and Advertising continue to grow on very large bases, Prime Video continues to expand, and new investment areas like GenAI, Kuiper, Healthcare, and several others are evolving nicely. And at the same time we're growing and inventing, we're also continuing to make progress on our cost structure and operating margins, which isn't easy to do. Overall, I like the direction in which we're heading and appreciate the hard work and ingenuity of our teams globally.When I think about my time at Amazon, I never imagined I'd be at the company for 27 years. My plan (which my wife and I agreed to on a bar napkin in 1997) was to be here a few years and move back to NYC. Part of why I've stayed has been the unprecedented growth (we had $15M of annual revenue the year before I joined\u2014this year should be well north of $600B), the perpetual hunger to invent, the obsession with making customers' lives easier and better every day, and the associated opportunities these priorities present. But, the biggest reason I'm still here is our culture. Being so customer focused is an inspiring part of it, but it's also the people we work with, the way we collaborate and invent when we're at our best, our long-term perspective, the ownership I've always felt at every level I've worked (I started as a Level 5), the speed with which we make decisions and move, and the lack of bureaucracy and politics.Our culture is unique, and has been one of the most critical parts of our success in our first 29 years. But, keeping your culture strong is not a birthright. You have to work at it all the time. When you consider the breadth of our businesses, their associated growth rates, the innovation required across each of them, and the number of people we've hired the last 6-8 years to pursue these endeavors, it's pretty unusual\u2014and will stretch even the strongest of cultures. Strengthening our culture remains a top priority for the s-team and me. And, I think about it all the time.We want to operate like the world's largest startup. That means having a passion for constantly inventing for customers, strong urgency (for most big opportunities, it's a race!), high ownership, fast decision-making, scrappiness and frugality, deeply-connected collaboration (you need to be joined at the hip with your teammates when inventing and solving hard problems), and a shared commitment to each other.Two areas that the s-team and I have been thinking about the last several months are: 1/ do we have the right org structure to drive the level of ownership and speed we desire? 2/ are we set up to invent, collaborate, and be connected enough to each other (and our culture) to deliver the absolute best for customers and the business that we can? We think we can be better on both.On the first topic, we've always sought to hire very smart, high judgment, inventive, delivery-focused, and missionary teammates. And, we have always wanted the people doing the actual detailed work to have high ownership. As we have grown our teams as quickly and substantially as we have the last many years, we have understandably added a lot of managers. In that process, we have also added more layers than we had before. It's created artifacts that we'd like to change (e.g., pre-meetings for the pre-meetings for the decision meetings, a longer line of managers feeling like they need to review a topic before it moves forward, owners of initiatives feeling less like they should make recommendations because the decision will be made elsewhere, etc.). Most decisions we make are two-way doors, and as such, we want more of our teammates feeling like they can move fast without unnecessary processes, meetings, mechanisms, and layers that create overhead and waste valuable time.So, we're asking each s-team organization to increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers by at least 15% by the end of Q1 2025. Having fewer managers will remove layers and flatten organizations more than they are today. If we do this work well, it will increase our teammates' ability to move fast, clarify and invigorate their sense of ownership, drive decision-making closer to the front lines where it most impacts customers (and the business), decrease bureaucracy, and strengthen our organizations' ability to make customers' lives better and easier every day. We will do this thoughtfully, and our PxT team will work closely with our leaders to evolve our organizations to accomplish these goals over the next few months.[By the way, I've created a \"Bureaucracy Mailbox\" for any examples any of you see where we might have bureaucracy or unnecessary process that's crept in and we can root out\u2026to be clear, companies need process to run effectively, and process does not equal bureaucracy, but unnecessary and excessive process or rules should be called out and extinguished. I will read these emails and action them accordingly.]To address the second issue of being better set up to invent, collaborate, and be connected enough to each other and our culture to deliver the absolute best for customers and the business, we've decided that we're going to return to being in the office the way we were before the onset of COVID. When we look back over the last five years, we continue to believe that the advantages of being together in the office are significant. I've previously explained these benefits (February 2023 post), but in summary, we've observed that it's easier for our teammates to learn, model, practice, and strengthen our culture; collaborating, brainstorming, and inventing are simpler and more effective; teaching and learning from one another are more seamless; and, teams tend to be better connected to one another. If anything, the last 15 months we've been back in the office at least three days a week has strengthened our conviction about the benefits.Before the pandemic, not everybody was in the office five days a week, every week. If you or your child were sick, if you had some sort of house emergency, if you were on the road seeing customers or partners, if you needed a day or two to finish coding in a more isolated environment, people worked remotely. This was understood, and will be moving forward as well. But, before the pandemic, it was not a given that folks could work remotely two days a week, and that will also be true moving forward\u2014our expectation is that people will be in the office outside of extenuating circumstances (like the ones mentioned above) or if you already have a Remote Work Exception approved through your s-team leader.We are also going to bring back assigned desk arrangements in locations that were previously organized that way, including the U.S. headquarters locations (Puget Sound and Arlington). For locations that had agile desk arrangements before the pandemic, including much of Europe, we will continue to operate that way.We understand that some of our teammates may have set up their personal lives in such a way that returning to the office consistently five days per week will require some adjustments. To help ensure a smooth transition, we're going to make this new expectation active on January 2, 2025. Global Real Estate and Facilities (GREF) is working on a plan to accommodate desk arrangements mentioned above and will communicate the details as they are finalized.I want to thank our leaders and support teams in advance for the work they will do to improve their org structures over the coming months. With a company of our size and complexity, the work won't be trivial and it will test our collective ability to invent and simplify when it comes to how we organize and go after the meaningful opportunities we have across all of our businesses.Having the right culture at Amazon is something I don't take for granted. I continue to believe that we are all here because we want to make a difference in customers' lives, invent on their behalf, and move quickly to solve their problems. I'm optimistic that these changes will better help us accomplish these goals while strengthening our culture and the effectiveness of our teams.Thanks, Andy " }, { "page": "https://www.cnbc.com/technology/?page=3", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/16/apple-releases-ios-18-for-iphones-without-include-apple-intelligence.html", "date": "Mon, Sep 16th 2024", "author": "Kif Leswing", "title": "Apple releases iOS 18 for iPhones, but it doesn't include Apple Intelligence", "content": "Apple on Monday released iOS 18, the latest version of its software for iPhones.This is Apple's biggest iPhone update of the year, but this rollout does not include the company's forthcoming artificial intelligence system, Apple Intelligence, which is the focus of Apple's new ads.

The rollout comes a week after Apple unveiled new versions of the iPhone, AirPods and Apple Watch. Preorders for the new iPhones began Friday and will be widely available on Sept. 20.Some consumer tech experts say the new iPhone hardware is best judged as incremental, and early data suggests demand could be sluggish, so neither the phone nor new artificial intelligence features will necessarily result in an upgrade supercycle. But for iPhone users, it's worth familiarizing yourself with the new operating system's Password Manager app and additional choices on how and where your data is accessed. That includes controls related to your personal and business contacts, and new ways to protect sensitive apps and associated information on devices that may be shared.Privacy professionals say updates for iOS 18, the public beta version of which has been available since July, should make it easier for consumers to understand and use available privacy protections.\"Apple continues to try to build privacy for its users, and it does typically try to make them easy for people to understand,\" said Jodi\u00a0Daniels, chief executive and privacy consultant at Red Clover Advisors.\u00a0Here's a rundown of some new security and privacy features and how to access them.A new Passwords app to improve on iCloud keychainApple has created a separate app for storing user passwords. Previously, passwords could be stored in iCloud Keychain, the password management system integrated into Apple devices, but a separate app makes access easier, privacy professionals said.\u00a0The new app has other features to promote good privacy practices. For instance, users are alerted if passwords or account credentials may have been part of data breaches, which can be helpful for fraud protection purposes. In addition, users who have a weak password or one that's been used before will be alerted so they can update that credential.\u00a0\"The broader goal is to have more people using unique passwords and having more general online security,\" said Thorin\u00a0Klosowski, security and privacy activist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit that focuses on privacy matters.As in the past, Apple can't access these passwords, but users can on iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple\u00a0Vision\u00a0Pro and on Windows with the iCloud for Windows app. Users of the AutoFill function will have their passwords automatically added to the Passwords\u00a0app.Users will also have quick access to categories of credentials including verification codes, passkeys and Wi-Fi passwords. Passwords can also be categorized under shared groups such as work or family.A way to lock and hide appsWith limited exceptions, apps on the phone can be either locked, or, for additional privacy, hidden if the user chooses. Basic functional apps can't be hidden, but generally speaking, if it's on the App Store it can be hidden, an Apple spokesperson said.This is a useful tool because people sometimes hand their phones to friends to show them photos, messages or emails, for example, or parents may offer their phones temporarily to children to play a game. In all these cases, users may not want others to have unfettered access to their phone.\u00a0When an app is in locked or hidden mode, content like messages or emails inside the app aren't searchable, and notifications don't pop up. Apps can be locked and unlocked with Face ID, Touch ID, if available, or the device passcode.Apple has also taken steps to help ensure young children don't use these features to thwart parental observation. Accountholders under age 13 can't lock or hide an app,\u00a0according to the Apple spokesperson. Users between the ages of 13 and 18 can use these functions, but parents can still see what apps were downloaded and how much they are used in Screen Time. Apple warns children in the older age group when they lock or hide an app that parents retain the ability to see that information.More control over contact-sharing\u00a0In iOS 18, consumers have the option to determine more precisely how they want their contacts shared with apps. They can choose to share all, none or specific contacts. So, if for example, a person uses an app solely for work, he might decide to share only work-related contacts with the app. Access can be updated as desired.When they update to iOS 18, users can change their settings for apps they already use. \"In practice, it will provide a little bit of a speed bump for people to think whether they really need an app to have access to their contacts,\" Klosowski said.A better view of data apps are accessing\u00a0Apple users can now see, at a glance, how many apps have access to data like location services, tracking, calendars, files and folders, contacts and health information. When they tap on a particular category, users see a list of which apps have what level of access, such as limited or full.AI privacy protections\u00a0Separately, Apple will soon be launching Apple Intelligence, an artificial intelligence platform developed by Apple. Its features include on-device processing so it's aware of your personal data, but doesn't require Apple to collect or store it, and a new complex system designed to draw on larger server-based models to handle more complex requests, while still protecting user privacy.These privacy protections can be important to users who want to have access to AI, but are concerned about privacy ramifications, including having their private data used to train models, which is a concern, even for many AI enthusiasts.\u00a0\"Having it local to the device reduces that risk,\" Daniels said.

Prices vary depending on insurance coverage, but the average in-lab test costs $3,000, according to a 2022 study in the Journal of Primary Care & Community Health.\u00a0At-home tests are often less expensive, but they can still cost hundreds of dollars. The at-home sleep apnea test from Sleep Doctor costs $189, for example. Apple's newest watch, the Series 10, starts at $399.\u00a0 Apple's sleep apnea detection feature is \"potentially a game changer\" for patients who have been reluctant to seek out testing, said Dr. David Kuhlmann, a physician who has treated sleep disorders for nearly two decades in Missouri. Kuhlmann also serves on the board of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, which is a professional society for sleep medicine clinicians.\u00a0\u00a0Kuhlmann said the feature could be especially helpful for patients who sleep alone, and he thinks a lot of people will be surprised to find out they're showing signs of sleep apnea.\u00a0\u00a0Even so, Kuhlmann said users should approach Apple's sleep apnea data with some caution, as readings could be erroneous. He said it is unlikely that insurance companies will begin paying for sleep apnea therapies like CPAP machines based on Apple Watch data alone, which is why it is important for patients to follow up with their health-care providers to get an official diagnosis.\u00a0\"People do need to be diagnosed in order to be treated,\" Kuhlmann told CNBC in an interview.\u00a0Kuhlmann said the feature will likely cause an increase in visits to health-care providers, which could ultimately reduce costs for the U.S. health-care system overall. Ideally, if patients catch sleep apnea earlier, they can avoid paying for treatments for more serious conditions down the line.\"By finding out that they have these underlying sleep disorders and getting them treated, it could potentially actually help save expenses and help improve quality of life.\"How it works\u00a0 Apple's sleep apnea detection feature works by analyzing a new metric that the company calls \"breathing disturbances.\" The Apple Watch identifies breathing disturbances by using an accelerometer to measure movements at the wrist that indicate disruptions to normal breathing patterns.\u00a0Users can view their nightly metrics in the Health app, where they'll be classified as either \"elevated\" or \"not elevated,\" i.e., normal. Apple will analyze this breathing disturbance data once a month and notify people if they show \"consistent signs\" of severe or moderate sleep apnea. Users can view their data over a one-month, six-month or one-year period.\u00a0The Apple Watch Series 10 supports an 18-hour battery life, so people who are interested in using this feature will likely need to charge their device during the day.Apple can also generate a report that users can bring to their doctors to discuss next steps. The report includes three months' worth of breathing disturbance data as well as some additional information, the company said. Users can access educational materials within the Health app as well.\u00a0Apple said that the notification algorithm was developed with \"an extensive data set of clinical-grade sleep apnea tests,\" and that the feature was validated in a clinical study.\"Now I'm jonesing to get an Apple [Watch] so I can try it out on myself,\" Kuhlmann said.

Additionally, intense competition in the Chinese market continues to impact iPhone demand.\"Last Monday, Apple unveiled new versions of the iPhone, AirPods and Apple Watch at an event at its headquarters in Cupertino, California. Pre-orders for the new iPhones began Friday and launch on Sept. 20, but the\u00a0first Apple Intelligence features for iPhone 16\u00a0won't launch until next month, in a beta version.Analysts at Barclays, JPMorgan and Bank of America also wrote in investor notes that shipping times could translate to lighter demand for the newest iPhone Pro models, compared with last year.\"Based on our conversations with distributors and analysis of pre-order figures on major Chinese e-commerce sites, total pre-order units were down Y/Y within the first couple of days, with a lower pro model mix,\" Barclays analysts wrote in a note. \"We heard that pro model units were down double digits on a Y/Y basis, while base and plus models grew Y/Y.\"The Barclays analysts added that the rollout of Apple Intelligence in the Chinese language \"is not until CY2025, which may dampen early enthusiasm for IP16. Weak macro and competition continue to weigh\u00a0on iPhone sales in China.\" They also wrote that Apple had to rely on significant discounts to help China sales for the iPhone 15.When tracking key markets' delivery lead times as a demand indicator, the JPMorgan analysts wrote that \"early lead-times are indicating demand on the iPhone 16 base models in-line to the iPhone 15 series during Week 1 (e.g., Pre-Order Week), while early demand indicators for Pro models are starting off modestly softer relative to the iPhone 15 series.\"BofA analysts wrote that after tracking iPhone ship dates on Apple's own website and various carrier websites, ship time \"for the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max models are extended, but somewhat less (on average) compared to last year at this point in the pre-order cycle.\"They added that \"though the extension of ship dates can be reflective of iPhone demand, other factors such as supply, inventory, allocation and pricing could be impacting the ship dates.\" The analysts also wrote that Apple reduced iPhone 16 prices in Australia and India.The iPhone 16 Pro and the iPhone 16 Pro Max are Apple's more premium phones that have nicer screens and cameras than the regular models, starting at $999 and $1,199, respectively.The Pro models have the \"thinnest borders on any Apple product,\" Apple said at its event last week, calling them \"by far our best iPhone displays ever.\" The titanium is nearly half the weight of stainless steel and is \"more scratch resistant than other forms of titanium others have used.\"The company also said during the event the new iPhone 16 Pro Max has \"the best iPhone battery life ever\" but did not offer additional details.\u2014 CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed reporting.

The city is suing him", "content": "Ransomware has long been plaguing American municipalities.\u00a0It appeared to be another typical ransomware attack that impacted the city of Columbus, Ohio, this past July.\u00a0The city's response to the hack, however, was not, and it has cybersecurity and legal experts across the country questioning its motives.Connor Goodwolf (legal name is David Leroy Ross) is an IT consultant who plumbs the dark web as part of his job. \"I track dark web-type crimes, criminal organizations, and stuff like what the Telegram CEO has been arrested for,\" Goodwolf said.So when word got out that the city of Columbus, his hometown, had been breached, Goodwolf did what he does: he poked around online.\u00a0It didn't take him long to discover what the hackers had in their possession.\"It wasn't the biggest, but it was one of the most impactful breaches I have seen,\" Goodwolf said.In some ways, he described it as a routine breach, with personal identifiable information, protected health information, Social Security numbers and driver's license photos exposed. However, because multiple databases were breached, it was more encompassing than other attacks. According to Goodwolf, the hackers had breached multiple databases from the city, the police, and the prosecutor's office.\u00a0There were arrest records and sensitive information about minors and domestic violence victims.\u00a0Some of the breached databases, he says, went back to 1999.\u00a0Goodwolf found over three terabytes of data that took over 8 hours to download.\"The first thing I see is the prosecutor's database, and I'm like 'holy sh-t' these are domestic violence victims.\u00a0When it comes to domestic violence victims, we need to protect them the most because they have already been victimized once, and now they are again by having their information exposed,\"\u00a0he said.Goodwolf's first action was to contact the city to let them know how serious the breach was, because what he saw contradicted official statements.\u00a0At a press conference on August 13, \u00a0Columbus Mayor Andrew Ginther said: \"The personal data that the threat actor published to the dark web was either encrypted or corrupted, so the majority of the data came by the threat actor is unusable.\"But what Goodwolf was finding didn't support that view. \"I tried to reach out to the city multiple times to multiple departments and was blown off,\" he said.Google-owned Mandiant, as well as many other top cybersecurity firms, have been tracking a continued increase in ransomware attacks, both in prevalence and severity, and the rise of the Rhysida Group behind the Columbus hack, which has come into prominence within the last year.The Rhysida Group claimed responsibility for the hack. While not much is known about the cyber gang, Goodwolf and other security experts say they appear to be state-sponsored and based in Eastern Europe, possibly linked to Russia. Goodwolf says these ransomware gangs are \"professional operations\" with a staff, paid vacation, and PR people.\"They have ramped up the attacks and targets since last autumn,\" he said.The U.S. government's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency issued a bulletin about Rhysida last November.Goodwolf said that because no one from the city responded to him he went to the local media and shared data with journalists to get the word out about the seriousness of the breach.\u00a0And that is when he heard from the city of Columbus, in the form of a lawsuit and a temporary restraining order preventing him from disseminating additional information.\u00a0The city defended its response in a statement to CNBC:\"The City initially moved to obtain this order, which was granted by the Court, to prevent the dissemination of sensitive and confidential information, potentially including the identities of undercover police officers, that threatens public safety and criminal investigations.\"The city's temporary 14-day restraining order against Goodwolf has since expired, and now it has a preliminary injunction and an agreement with Goodwolf not to release more data.\"It should be noted that the Court order does not prohibit the defendant from discussing the data breach or even describing what kind of data was exposed,\" the city's statement added. \"It simply prohibits the individual from disseminating the stolen data posted on the dark web. The City remains engaged with federal authorities and cyber security experts to respond to this cyber intrusion.\"Meanwhile, the mayor did have to perform a mea culpa at a subsequent press conference, saying his initial statements were based on the information he had at the time.\u00a0\"It was the best information we had at the time. Clearly, we discovered that that was inaccurate information and I have to accept responsibility for that.\"Realizing the exposure to residents was greater than first thought, the city is offering two years of free credit monitoring from Experian.\u00a0This includes anyone who has had contact with the city of Columbus via an arrest or other business. Columbus is also working with Legal Aid to see what additional protections are needed for domestic violence victims who may have been compromised or\u00a0need help with civil protection orders.To date, the city has not paid the hackers, who were demanding $2 million in ransom.\u00a0 \u00a0'He's Not Edward Snowden'Those who study cybersecurity law and work within the realm expressed surprise at Columbus filing a civil lawsuit against the researcher.\"Lawsuits against data security researchers are rare,\" said Raymond Ku, professor of law at\u00a0Case Western\u00a0Reserve University. On the rare occasion they do happen, he said, it is usually when the researcher is alleged to have disclosed how a flaw was or can be exploited, which would then allow others to take advantage of the flaw as well.\"He wasn't Edward Snowden,\"\u00a0said Kyle Hanslovan, CEO of cybersecurity company Huntress, who described himself as troubled by the city of Columbus's response and what it could mean for future breaches. Snowden was a government contract employee who leaked classified information and faced criminal charges, but considered himself a whistleblower. Goodwolf, Hanslovan says, is a Good Samaritan who independently found the breached data.\"In this case, it appears we have just silenced someone who, as far as I can tell, appears to be a security researcher who did the bare minimum and confirmed the official statements made were not true.\u00a0This can't possibly be an appropriate use of the courts,\" Hanslovan said, predicting the case will be quickly overturned.Columbus City Attorney Zach Klein said during a September press conference that the case was \"not about freedom of speech or whistleblowing. This is about downloading and disclosure of stolen criminal investigatory records.\"Hanslovan worries about the ripple effect where cybersecurity consultants and researchers are afraid to do their jobs for fear of being sued. \"The bigger story here is are we seeing the emergence of a new playbook\" for hacking response in which individuals are silenced, and that should not be welcomed, he said. \"Silencing any opinion, even for 14 days, could be enough to prevent something credible from coming to light, and that terrifies me,\" Hanslovan said. \"That voice needs to be heard. As we see bigger cybersecurity incidents come up, I am worried that folks will be more concerned bringing them to light.\"Scott Dylan, founder of United Kingdom-based venture capital firm NexaTech Ventures, also thinks the actions of the city of Columbus could induce a chilling effect on the field of cybersecurity.\"As the field of cyberlaw continues to mature, this case is likely to be referenced in future discussions about the role of researchers in the aftermath of data breaches,\" Dylan said.He says legal frameworks must evolve to keep pace with the sophistication of both cyberattacks and the ethical dilemmas they generate, and the approach taken by Columbus is a mistake.Meanwhile, the legal process will grind on for Goodwolf.\u00a0Despite Columbus and Goodwolf reaching an agreement last week on the dissemination of information, the city is still suing him for damages in a civil suit that could reach $25,000 or higher. Goodwolf is representing himself in his talks with the city, though says that he has a lawyer on standby, if needed.Some residents have filed a class-action lawsuit against the city.\u00a0Goodwolf says that 55% of the information breached has been sold onto the dark web, while 45% is available for anyone with the skills to access it.Dylan thinks the city is taking a big risk, even if its actions may be legally defensible, by creating the appearance of an attempt to silence discourse rather than encourage transparency. \"It's a strategy that could backfire, both in terms of public trust and future litigation,\"\u00a0he said.\"I am hoping the city realizes the mistake of filing a civil suit and the implications not just on security,\"\u00a0Goodwolf said, noting that\u00a0Intel is spending billions, with significant federal government support, to build chipmaking facilities in a Columbus suburb. In recent years, the city has been positioning itself as a new tech hub in the Midwest's \"Silicon Heartland,\" and attacking white hats and cybersecurity researchers, he said, could cause some in the tech sector to rethink it as a location.

On the plus side, the cryptocurrency rose 12% in the past seven days and the network hash rate\u00a0hit an all-time high. Hash rate refers to the collective computing power of all miners in the bitcoin network, and the recent high suggests there have never been more miners online, actively securing the network.At the same time, another key metric this week showed it's increasingly difficult to make money in the mining business. Investment bank Jefferies wrote in a report that crypto mining was \"significantly\" less profitable in August. The average daily revenue per exahash, or income per miner, fell by 11.8% from the prior month, Jefferies said. As bitcoin becomes more of an established, and even mainstream part of the economy, the days of easy money appear to be in the rearview mirror. Institutional capital has poured in since the SEC approved spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds in January, and the bitcoin network is more robust than ever, held together by a vast and decentralized network of miners securing transactions with the help of large banks of machines.But more people \u2014 and their powerful machines \u2014 are vying for smaller rewards.In April, the bitcoin code automatically cut new issuance of the world's largest cryptocurrency in half, an event that occurs roughly every four years to create scarcity. The halving historically precedes a wave of bankruptcies among bitcoin mining firms, which are suddenly generating much less revenue with the same level of operating costs.  Bitcoin miners are getting hammered by Wall Street.Marathon Digital is down nearly 30% in 2024, while Riot Platforms has fallen 53%. The price of bitcoin, meanwhile, is up about 44% this year. Jefferies said North American publicly traded mining firms minted a smaller share of new bitcoin in August compared to July, falling to 19.9% of the total network. They're still spending on equipment upgrades, meaning  efficiency is improving but economics are getting worse.Marathon CEO Fred Thiel told CNBC that, due to the upgrade cycle, machines are able to hash twice as much as previous models with the same energy use.\"No need to add sites or power, just upgrade systems,\" Thiel said.Riot CEO Jason Les is as bullish as ever on the future of bitcoin despite the challenging economic conditions. He said \"bitcoin is the most sound money in the world,\" and \"low-cost mining is an efficient way to get exposure to it.\"Not all miners are feeling the pinch. Companies like Core Scientific, which emerged from bankruptcy in January, are finding ways to use their massive infrastructure to power artificial intelligence and high-performance computing (HPC).Last month, Core\u00a0announced an expanded deal worth $6.7 billion with\u00a0CoreWeave, an\u00a0Nvidia-backed startup that's providing the chipmaker's graphics processing units (GPUs) for running AI models.\u00a0In a note this week, Bernstein singled out Core Scientific as the best-performing publicly traded bitcoin miner, noting that of the miners that have diversified into AI and HPC, Core is the \"only one with a material co-location contract with a leading GPU Cloud provider.\"Core has more than doubled in value since its return to the stock market and now has a market cap of close to $3 billion. \"Our facilities were developed to be multi-use for not only just bitcoin mining, but also for the transition that we're doing right now to high-performance computing,\" Core CEO Adam Sullivan told CNBC.Bernstein added that if Core executes all of its 700 megawatt capacity that it's allocated to AI and HPC, it would make the company the third-largest data center company listed in the U.S.\"It's really about the next three years in terms of where the opportunity set truly lies to capture a large portion of the data center market,\" Sullivan said. \"Every big data center company that exists carved out a niche, just so happens that the niche that bitcoin miners are carving out now are in the largest niche that has ever been found in the data center industry.\" \u2014 CNBC's Talia Kaplan and Jordan Smith contributed to this report.WATCH: Core Scientific CEO Adam Sullivan on why the company has embraced AI " }, { "page": "https://www.cnbc.com/technology/?page=3", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/13/brazil-supreme-court-unfreezes-assets-of-elon-musks-starlink-x.html", "date": "Fri, Sep 13th 2024", "author": "Lora Kolodny", "title": "Brazil supreme court unfreezes assets of Elon Musk's Starlink, X after taking fines", "content": "Brazil's supreme court announced Friday that it ordered banks to transfer funds from Starlink and X accounts to pay fines the court levied against Elon Musk's social network.The court's top justice, Alexandre de Moraes, and a panel of five other justices, found that X had repeatedly violated Brazilian law when it refused to appoint a legal representative in the country, and when it refused to remove content or profiles from its platform that the court determined to be harmful towards democratic institutions in Brazil.The court had nearly 18.4 million Brazilian reals, or approximately $3.3 million, transferred out of the accounts. Musk acquired X, then known as Twitter, in 2022. Starlink is the satellite internet service run by SpaceX.Following the transfers, the court ordered that the frozen bank accounts and assets of X and Starlink be released, saying there was no longer any need to keep them.The court suspended X at the end of August, and the suspension remains in place.\u00a0Musk and his businesses have said they view the actions of de Moraes as \"illegal,\" and his court's orders as having been issued without due process. X and SpaceX did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Friday.Brazilian news agency UOL reported earlier this month that some of the accounts de Moraes ordered Musk to suspend at X belong to users who allegedly threatened federal police officers involved in a probe of former right-wing Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro.Bolsonaro has been accused of instigating Brazil's Jan. 8 riots and of attempting to stage a coup there.Musk is a proponent of Bolsonaro, in part because the former Brazilian president authorized his business Starlink to operate in the country.Musk has been ramping up insults and calls to impeach de Moraes since April. On Sept. 5, his long-time collaborator at the helm of SpaceX, COO Gwynne Shotwell, also took shots at the Brazil supreme court online.She wrote, \"@Alexandre, please stop harassing Starlink and let us keep serving the people of Brazil.\"Backers of de Moraes and the STF have seen the orders against X Corp. as an assertion of Brazilian sovereignty.WATCH: New data shows Musk's Twitter takeover is worst deal for banks since 2008 financial crisis " }, { "page": "https://www.cnbc.com/technology/?page=3", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/13/microstrategy-pops-8percent-after-upping-bitcoin-holdings-to-14point6-billion.html", "date": "Fri, Sep 13th 2024", "author": "MacKenzie Sigalos", "title": "MicroStrategy stock pops 8% after company ups bitcoin holdings to $14.6 billion", "content": "MicroStrategy shares jumped more than 8% on Friday after founder Michael Saylor said the company purchased another $1.1 billion worth of bitcoin.The stock jumped 24% for the week and is now up 124% this year.Saylor said in a post on social media platform X that MicroStrategy's average purchase price in the four years it has been buying bitcoin is $38,585 per coin.
